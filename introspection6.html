                    Main, side, drink. What does that mean to you? A set meal? Or a set of men? Your main guy, side guy, 
                    and the guy you message on drunk nights for hook-ups. Pre-pandemic, I had all of them, one guy for every occasion, 
                    one for the type of company I wanted that day. Needless to say, I was occupied and extremely 
                    satisfied, what can I say? I have a high libido. 
                    Men would call it their roster so that they didn't get attached, 
                    or they had another one in line just in case one got attached. 
                    Me? I thought each guy served a different purpose, 
                    whether that be one that was handy when it came to 
                    helping with work, one that was good in bed (that's a lie they were all good in bed – some more than others but hey! They all had their specialities, so I had to keep them all) and one with a real connection who was easy to talk to. Covid made me pick and choose. Some left on their own, some left due to familial obligations, and some stayed. Not saying that Covid made me monogamous, but it did help me realise which was the better guy, which was the guy that would bother checking up on me, helping me through my BA dissertation. I had always believed that open relationships and casually seeing men were ideal for a commitment-phobe like me. It helped build trust and transparency with sexual partners and made me feel more secure that he was telling me everything, there was no hiding, what better way to build up to exclusivity? 

                </p>

                <p>
                    However, as two men left my menu, one was left. We somehow decided without deciding that the "support bubble" was each other. That being said, old me was thinking that he just wanted me as a convenient vagina, since we were both left without flatmates during lockdown. Things became more constant, sleepovers and dinners and breakfast to be specific. Which yikes, that was brand-new territory. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    "So you're exclusive, right?" <br/>
                    "No, not really we just like spending weekends together to drink and have dinner and sex, eat breakfast together, not like we can do anything else really, he is my only entertainment out there"<br/>
                    "But it's exclusive?" <br/>
                    "I mean for the time being, I guess? But for health and safety reasons only" 

                </p>

                <p>
                    "For health and safety reasons only" still echoes to me post lockdown. Made me wonder, "what now?" I was suddenly insecure again. Did Covid make me want monogamy? Did Covid make me monogamous without knowing it? 

                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe I could say Covid propelled me to wonder where this was going, made me think of reasons why he chose me to have sex with during lockdown. And that it was something that scared me. It was marching me closer to the point where people would label what you're doing as "a relationship" and with that word comes a set of expectations, especially once restrictions had been lifted. Would he meet my friends? Does this mean I have to meet his friends? What about our nights in? Would that still continue?, would I have to order 2 cocktails, and grab 2 glasses, cutlery, and plates? Do I have to remember what his favourite drink is? Will he help me move apartments? Did I have to be emotionally supportive to him like how he was to me?

                </p>

                <p>
                    All this I have experienced since post lockdown. He met my friends, he still made time to see me weekdays and weekends, continued emotional and physical support, and yet people ask me:

                </p>

                <p>
                    "So you're dating"<br/>
                    "Are you just going to continue without a label? Don't you feel you need assurance?" <br/>
                    "So where is it going to end up leading to though?"

                </p>

                <p>
                    To be honest, I don't know, because there are no obligations and the fun of it is seeing boundaries get pushed every month, it's still a game that old me was used to. Maybe we are both scared, but not knowing keeps it interesting. Because there were no words like "relationship" forcing him to come to mine or helping me move, or being forced to have dinners with my friends. He chose me to be his bubble, and somehow that was reassuring. No expectations or contracts, his willing presence meant more to me because I could know for certain that it was just his own mind bringing him to do the things with me and choosing to see me, not out of a label of expectations and obligations. And so far that's good enough for me. And hey for a commitment-phobe like me, being monogamous for 11 months was already a win and made me think that I could be monogamous if he asked me to. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    So I continue to ask myself, "who is going to take the next step? Him or me?"
