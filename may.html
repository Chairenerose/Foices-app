                        <p>
                            The night of December 31st 2019, was a special night for everyone. A new decade awaited us
                            all, which many associated
                            with new beginnings and unrealistic promises. I was heavily affected by the latter.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As I savored my prosecco rosé, I wrote a letter to my future self, where I outlined
                            everything I wanted to accomplish by
                            the end of 2020. What began as a waltz between the current version of myself and the
                            powerful Michelle Obama—whom for
                            me, like many others is a constant source of inspiration. Ended with a list of dull goals,
                            any young lady who had been
                            heartbroken, gained a few pounds, or a victim of consumerism could have composed. Every goal
                            I had written had a theme
                            of self-transformation with the intent of receiving external validation. Little did I know
                            that my incapability of
                            smartly setting goals would not define 2020. Instead, it would be defined by a global
                            pandemic that not only interrupted
                            a normative routine/lifestyle for so many, but it further amplified racial and social
                            injustices through a racially
                            divisive lens.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When I first caught wind of the pandemic and how my busy yet unfulfilling life was about to
                            change drastically, I was
                            delighted. It meant that I had an excuse to not keep up with my social circles. My relief
                            screamed 'privileged', whilst
                            many worried about job and food security; I embraced that the urgency of meeting my
                            commitments were gradually fading.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This time of solitude provided by the pandemic revealed the urgency to relearn how to live
                            for myself. Without a doubt,
                            I believed composing a new list of goals was the best way to approach this successfully.
                            However, this time, I decided
                            to write down everything that made me happy and enjoy life more.
                        </p>

                        <p>With the intent of being as honest as possible, my list illuminated that I was a food-loving,
                            reality tv admirer who
                            cared about making an impact on the world. I tackled this premature epitaph of myself by
                            doing each of the things on my
                            list within one week. Other than this approach being far from fulfilling, it was also
                            draining and exhausting.</p>

                        <p>
                            As I enjoyed my banana brownies and listened to a <a
                                href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/women-of-impact/id1435217865">podcast</a> by
                            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/womenofimpact/">Women of Impact</a>, I realised that the
                            past week I had been
                            forcing myself to do 'joyful' things, making those things draining, as it felt like quite a
                            superficial approach to this
                            drastic change. My unsuccessful approach did not mean that I was out of touch with my
                            feelings; I just needed a break to
                            breathe and come to terms with myself.
                        </p>

                        <div class="text-image">
                            <img src="./Images/reflectionchair.png" id="reflectimage1">
                            <p><i>Image: My What Makes Me Happy List</i></p>
                        </div>

                        <p>It was time to integrate my essential self. The focus here was to review my life and
                            happiness triggers. After doing so,
                            I concluded that my 'what makes me happy' list was at surface level reflective of my
                            “goals”, that I wanted to achieve.
                            But looking back at it - this list like many others - reminded me of how unnecessary
                            and how out of touch those goals were with my true feelings, as I was suffering from
                            emotional exhaustion at the time of
                            writing it. By forcing myself to
                            activate my happy hormones, I was indirectly punishing myself for being sad. If this year
                            has taught me anything, it is
                            that it is okay not to be okay. Sometimes permitting yourself to let out your sadness is the
                            best way to trigger your
                            happiness.
                        </p>

                            By unlearning one's own ‘normative’ life patterns through this global pandemic, and
                            understanding the nuances of our
                            relational dynamics, this year has helped us gain clarity around our ever changing reality,
                            as we had to come to terms
                            with how our well being can fluctuate so easily and readily depending on each day of the
                            past year. As I come to terms
                            with what this year long pandemic meant for me, I have to acknowledge my own positionality
                            and privilege, knowing I had
                            a house to continue living in, and friends and family there to support me whatever the
                            circumstances.

                        <p>
                            As I continued writing my MA thesis during the many lockdowns that happened, Lisa Bowleg’s
                            article <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305766">‘We’re
                                not all in
                                this together’</a>, led me to further understand the opposing effects of this global
                            lockdown. This article resonated with a number of
                            readers, seeing as Bowleg states that throughout history, these situations of global unrest
                            and anxiety caused by a
                            pandemic have produced statements of solidarity and uplifting claims, such as ‘we’re all in
                            this together’ - when in
                            reality “we could maintain the inequitable status quo and acknowledge “we’re all in this
                            together” for what it is:
                            another hollow platitude of solidarity designed to placate the privileged and temporarily
                            uncomfortable and
                            inconvenienced” (Bowleg, 2020). Understanding the historical and statistical nuances around
                            this term of solidarity also
                            led me to approach these times of introspection in an extremely realistic way, knowing how
                            polarized the effects of this
                            pandemic have become. My own experiences, have ultimately been moulded and influenced by my
                            own positionality, which is
                            ultimately one of privilege; as like many others, I thought of new hobbies to pick up during
                            the lockdown, what to cook
                            and bake, and how to keep up with friends and family during zoom calls and quizzes.

                            However, feelings of anxiety and loneliness were rife for countless family and friends
                            during this year - as my elders
                            had to isolate completely by themselves, following the strict measures of what the lockdown
                            entailed - unable to spend
                            time with anyone for months on end, and solely seeing faces across a computer screen. Hence,
                            with this March 2021
                            marking a year since the first lockdown in the Netherlands and across Europe, we wanted to
                            give thought and
                            consideration to what the past 12 months have meant for us, our writing, our growth, and
                            more importantly our relational
                            dynamics. Moving through this restless, yet simultaneously static, time I’ve understood not
                            only my position, as Bowleg
                            refers to within this system of “power and inequality which is structured for different
                            groups”, but the importance and
                            focality we have to place on unlearning these entrenched logics of ‘optimism and positivity’
                            (Bowleg, 2020). Because if
                            anything this past year has taught me that 2021 will not necessarily bring positive change
                            and prosperity and all those
                            other mantras for everyone, but it's just a continuation of the now, albeit with a different
                            number. So instead of
                            focusing on the what ifs, and constantly thinking about the next steps, I am just trying to
                            identify the dials I can
                            regulate myself; which ones I can direct, and knowing that I have the agency to actually do
                            so. The agency to resist, to
                            speak up, to know what battles are worth fighting for, and to ultimately be more present.
                            The past year with its ongoing
                            and relentless stream of headlines and news stories, has shown me, quite literally, that
                            being physically or virtually
                            here in the present is oftentimes the most critical thing to do. We are all living through
                            times of change and
                            continuous disquietude, and by being in the present moment (intentionally and at one's own
                            capacity) we are able to see
                            each turning point, each historical event happening before us. Realizing what it means to
                            actively see, to listen more,
                            to read, and to speak up.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although at times, it is so easy to be readily saturated with streams of real-time
                            information, the last months of 2021
                            has shown me that finding an equilibrium between planning ahead in order to escape our
                            current reality - and also just
                            simply switching off sometimes (both your phone, your electronic devices, and your mental
                            capacity to carry every single
                            news headline that pops up each morning) is not only necessary, but it has constantly
                            reminded me of this relationality;
                            of reminding myself to be both present and absent - and again knowing which dials I can
                            direct myself.

                            For many, the pandemic provided us with the opportunity to take care of ourselves. As well
                            as change our lives for the
                            better. From venturing into a new career to adopting a healthy lifestyle, many have used
                            this time at home to reevaluate
                            their priorities and replace sabotaging habits with propitious ones. ‘Reinventing’ your life
                            by making
                            (personal/individual) changes has become quite popular during the pandemic and sharing those
                            personal reinventions
                            online has become a consequent effect of the public visibility these platforms provide. From
                            drastic weight loss videos
                            to sharing the process of great business ideas that pivoted during the pandemic; social
                            media has become the most
                            favoured platform for sharing success and receiving feedback, congratulations, or approval
                            in return.

                        <p>
                            Honor Whiteman explains in <a
                                href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/275361">MedicalNewsToday</a> the direct
                            impact profit-based and accessible
                            digital social platforms have
                            on our mental health and what makes them so addicting. The report reveals that social media
                            can create negative
                            behaviour patterns and influence how users perceive themselves, affecting their overall
                            confidence. Whiteman suggests
                            that the relational link between social media and our contemporary context are mutually
                            constitutive with the need to
                            belong and relate to this electronic domain, thus this platform, albeit with its pros and
                            cons, has become the
                            perpetrator for this addiction to wanting to 'relate and belong, to the majority (Whiteman,
                            2015). He further states
                            that the rise in popularity and visibility of uploading 'fitness transformation' videos,
                            though sometimes motivating,
                            could stem from us wanting to mitigate negative emotions created from making romanticized
                            comparisons with others'
                            idealized online versions of themselves. The problem here is that the use of social media
                            has become irrational and
                            excessive, allowing for this comparative dynamic, between us and what we are seeing, to turn
                            into a destructive domino
                            effect. Thus, leading it to interfere massively with our daily lives.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We, as a society, are very visual. Hence, transformation videos with the most noticeable
                            improvements are likely to
                            receive the most online praise. Although online praise may be initially satisfying, the
                            impulse and or growing
                            inclination to amplify online/digital recognition based on the most drastic transformation
                            journeys - through videos or
                            pictures - can become one of the main driving factors towards self-sabotaging behaviour. For
                            instance, taking extreme
                            measures to achieve drastic weight loss, followed by the sharing of that achievement online
                            with the hopes of receiving
                            a multitude of praise. When I look at myself, there is evidence of allowing positive body
                            transformation videos to
                            trigger negative emotions. Those triggers eventually correlate to the growth of participants
                            in extreme weight loss
                            challenges. And the decline of individuals adopting more sustainable and healthy habits that
                            may result in slow weight
                            loss, which is more tenable both for oneself and the unlearning of these destructive weight
                            loss habits.

                        <p>
                            My approach to achieving extreme weight loss is an example of how the viral trend of sharing
                            self-improvement videos may
                            influence individuals to adopt an intangible lifestyle. Emphasising the importance of
                            considering your intent before
                            embarking on a journey that may transform your life. It is clear to me that the next time I
                            contemplate developing a
                            fitness mindset and changing my body, I should clarify the intentions I want to set for
                            myself. Whether they are rooted
                            in simply feeling better, to start eating healthier, or whether they are a product of
                            external (societal) pressure. By
                            clarifying my intentions, I may understand the end results better and identify the end
                            beneficiaries. It is vital to
                            establish the end beneficiaries of your goals as by doing so, if, for instance,if you are
                            not one of the beneficiaries,
                            achieving that goal may leave an unfulfilling inkling.

                        <p>
                            Ethnic, exotic, oriental, are all terms and words that I've heard on countless occasions to
                            describe not only Asian
                            cuisines and dishes, but they are more prominently associated with the depiction and
                            representation of Asian women, both
                            onscreen and in our current contextual setting. The seminal and heavily cited work by Edward
                            Said, has coined this form
                            of exoticization of the East, or 'the Orient', in his work <a
                                href="https://www.eaford.org/site/assets/files/1631/said_edward1977_orientalism.pdf">Orientalism</a>
                            in which he "considers Orientalism as a powerful European ideological creation - a way for
                            writers, philosophers and
                            colonial administrators to deal with the 'otherness' of eastern culture, customs and
                            beliefs" (Said, 2003). Thus, giving
                            way to contemporary racist beliefs and Othering philosophies within our contextual setting.
                            The ‘orientalizing’ of
                            entire people groups and countries has filtered into our everyday vernacular – when speaking
                            about Other(s), and trying
                            to superimpose this Orientalist ideology within the everyday.

                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, my own experiences, like so many others in my social environment, have become
                            a by-product of this
                            dynamic between the hyper-sexualisation of Asian females and media-generated representations
                            of women in manga/anime
                            that have permeated into Eurocentric media outlets and pop-culture - along with early onset
                            depictions of Asian female
                            characters in Hollywood, with movies such as Daughter of Dragon (1931), The World of Suzie
                            Wong (1960), Year of the
                            Dragon (1985).

                        <p>
                            Having moved from San Francisco to Rome during my early adolescent years, I was made so
                            readily aware of how my physical
                            features immediately defined me to others around me: being called cinesina (which literally
                            translates into small
                            Chinese girl) and constantly being reminded how 'flat' my face was, or how ‘oriental’ I
                            looked. How I looked and sounded
                            to the rest of the people in my classroom became so embedded in how I viewed myself, as
                            always different to the rest of
                            my (white) classmates, constantly exoticized through this Othering lens.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now I’ve had the chance to speak more and more about these instances of microaggressions and
                            racism that occured at such
                            an early age with other friends, who had also experienced the same types of interactions.
                            This has made me realize just
                            how normalized this form of sexualized racism is, which led me – like others – to oftentimes
                            suppress this responsive
                            anger or irritation towards these comments, seeing as it felt like even if we said something
                            back then it wouldn’t make
                            a difference, as even the teachers in these classrooms were aware of these comments being
                            said and still remained
                            silent.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Immediately defining a person based on their 'oriental and exotic' features, has created
                            demeaning and degrading
                            language and has constructed racial tropes that have led people to think they are able to
                            pinpoint everything about a
                            woman solely based on the fact that 'she looks Asian'. These stereotyped tropes are so
                            deeply imbedded in historical
                            depictions of Asian women, and as suggested by cultural theorist and scholar Stuart Hall,
                            these constructions of
                            Other(ness) are heavily intertwined with identity politics, which “get hold of the few
                            simple and easily grasped,
                            characteristics about a person and reduce everything about the person to those traits,
                            fixing them into eternity”
                            (Merskin, 2009). It is precisely this notion of longevity that upholds and reinforces racial
                            caricatures in our everyday
                            life. This is exemplified through several North American comedy films that make fun of Asian
                            nail salons and their
                            employees' accents, or martial arts movies that play upon these embedded stereotypes of the
                            'kung fu master', or the
                            submissive Asian sub-character. Hall further speaks about how "consistency of stereotypical
                            portrayals is likely to add
                            credibility to those portrayals, as they take on an aura of naturalness and truth" (Merskin,
                            2009). Hence, these
                            portrayals are "constantly reified through the lack of contradictory images and information"
                            (Merskin, 2009), present in
                            our spaces of the everyday, as a byproduct of media-generated stereotypes.

                            filmmaker, director and
                            performer, whose work HOME speaks directly to this ongoing and normalized take on the
                            fetishization of Asian women, by primarily
                            white-cis men. Takenaka recorded countless conversations in bars, on dates, and in ubers
                            with men commenting on her own
                            heritage, her appearance, and making sweeping statements on their 'take' on Asian cultural,
                            culinary histories, and
                            Asian countries. She directly conveys the shared interaction we as asian women face with
                            strangers who try to ‘flirt’ by
                            guessing our ethnicity, or by saying that 'they just have a thing' for Asian women. These
                            interactions are the product
                            of centuries of degrading interpretations of East Asia and Southeast Asian (visual) culture,
                            which has moulded
                            sexualized representations of Asian women; depicted as cute and or submissive.

                            Takenaka films her blank facial expressions as she records herself listening to these audio
                            recordings. Her building
                            anger and frustration are all subtly shown through her blankness, the slight raising of her
                            eyebrows, and her side eye.
                            Her still shots not only depict just how normalized these interactions are, especially in
                            Western Europe and North
                            America, but they show how oftentimes these statements saying, that “I looooove asian food,
                            but will never eat chicken
                            feet”, generate such a disbelief upon hearing them that the rage and anger one feels towards
                            these comments can be
                            processed much later on. In fact, as stated by Takenaka herself “she sat there in disbelief
                            every time digesting the
                            audacity of these men, recording and archiving allowed me the space to know that one day, my
                            anger and trauma would be
                            used for something; it would not swallow or eat me whole then or now" (Takenaka, 2021).

                            Takenaka’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/242145479"><i>HOME</i></a> video is triggering me for
                            me, like many others, yet it can be seen as a way to convey just how intertwined racism and
                            hyper-fetishisization are, and although it "centers Takenaka's Othering in such close
                            proximity to whiteness” (Takenaka,
                            2021), this video pushes forth new types of discussions, ones of outrage and of showing just
                            how universal these
                            experiences can be for so many women.

                            Ultimately, I believe that we can celebrate differences (whether that be cultural, social,
                            and or historical), as
                            ‘difference’ is not the issue here. It is how we frame, depict, represent, and speak about
                            differences that leads there
                            to be such polarizing, degrading, and fetishizing representations of Asian women - through a
                            sexual, racial, and
                            ethnicizing lens. In order to unmake the decades of stereotyped and fetishized tropes
                            surrounding Asian (femme)
                            representation, we have to start creating a space for discussion: through artworks, through
                            music, through film, in
                            which (accessible) discussions are designed and displayed for the people and do not simply
                            reproduce the same logic of
                            display about Others. These conversations can acts as a crucial tool in the reimagining of a
                            logic of representation,
                            and of difference that discards linearity and completely unmakes a heteronormative logic of
                            racial governance and
                            fetishization. Organizations like <a

                            rethink a future in which racial
                            stereotyping, hate crimes and hyper fetishization have no place to be reified within. Where
                            our cultural and social
                            ‘differences’ are no longer seen as a 'marker' to hyper sexualize or fetishize us.
