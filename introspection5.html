                    I want to preface this piece by saying that I am by no means an expert in polyamory, all I know is what I’ve read, learned online and experienced myself as a polyamorous person. If you want to take a deeper look in to what ethical non-monogamy entails, check out these Instagram pages:

                    Alternatively, I would recommend reading '<a>The Ethical Slut</a>' by Dossie Easton and Janet W. Hardy, 
                    and <a href="https://www.morethantwo.com/">'More Than Two’</a> by Eve Rickert and Franklin Veaux. My partner and I read both of these books together before we embarked on our own polyamorous adventure, and we definitely wouldn’t have managed so well without them!

                </p>

                <p>
                    A lot of the language used in ethical non-monogamy is either brand new to some people, or else they have different understanding of terms, so I’m going to begin by sharing my own definitions of a few key things, so we’re all on the same page. (This isn’t to say I came up with the definitions, this is just how I understand them.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Monogamy</strong> - the practice of having only one partner, or feelings for one person, at a time. This is the most common relationship structure found in modern western society. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Open relationships/ ethical non-monogamy</strong> - – This is an umbrella term for any relationship that isn’t strictly ‘monogamous.’ Open relationships vary between partners- anything from being able to kiss strangers on a night out, to having full-blown relationships with more than one person, fall under the ethical non- monogamy umbrella. Why ethical? Because ALL PARTIES have to be fully informed and consenting of the relationship structure. Otherwise, it’s cheating. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Cheating</strong> Non-ethical monogamy. One or more partners are either unaware or non-consenting of the open nature of the relationship. YES, you can have cheating in polyamory. NO, polyamory and cheating are not “basically the same thing”. Consent is key. Always. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Polygamory ('poly)</strong> - Falls under the ethical non-monogamy umbrella. Polyamorous people can have feelings for more than one person at a time, and may have more than one partner at any given moment. Poly people are still polyamorous even when they are single. Much as a gay person is still gay even if they are single. You can delve further into this in the resources I have shared above, but that’s the basics for now. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Polygamy</strong> - The practice of having more than one WIFE at a time. i.e. one husband with five sister wives. This is a cultural and religious practice seen in many parts of the world; however, it is not synonymous with polyamory, as it does not recognise the woman’s* right to have multiple partners.
                </p>

                <p>*<i>I have tried to keep my language as inclusive as possible. I recognise that womxn is usually the ‘inclusive’ term for ‘women’, but as trans and female-identifying individuals are women, I see no reason to differentiate the terms.
                </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, please note that relationships don’t have to be sexual or romantic in nature. Many a-sexual and a-romantic individuals are drawn to ethical non-monogamy as it allows them to have non-platonic partnerships, while giving their non- asexual/ aromantic partner the opportunity to find sexual/romantic fulfilment elsewhere. 

                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Now that we’re all on the same page, I can give you a little insight in to my own polyamorous experience. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    I have had three long-term relationships in my life. Two of those were monogamous and the last was poly. Although I enjoyed both of my monogamous relationships, I always felt somewhat trapped by the societal norms and structures that were forced on me as soon as I entered into a monogamous partnership. It’s not just not being able to sleep with other people, but the possessiveness that conventional monogamy teaches us. WHY does cutting myself off from all other avenues of non-platonic love demonstrate how much I care for someone? WHY does touching your genitals and no one else’s for the rest of eternity prove that I am a good and loyal partner? What is with these random rules on how to ‘correctly’ love someone? Surely the gauge of a good partner should be measured in support given, healthy communication and mutual respect? I can give my partners all of those things and flirt with the cute barista at my local coffee shop. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    For me, polyamory offered the opportunity to tailor my relationships to me and my partners. There were no preconceived rules to follow, we could decide exactly what was allowed and what wasn’t. For example, were we even allowed to sleep with other people? (we were), did we want to know if our partner had slept with somebody else (we did), did we have to use a condom with new partners (we did), was oral sex allowed (it was)- anything you can imagine, we decided on it. In fact, we even had a Google doc where we wrote down things we discussed, so if one of us slipped up we could go back and see what we had agreed. (For example, we had an agreement that we wouldn’t kiss or go home with someone else while we were both at the same party. One of us forgot and the other got upset about it, so instead of arguing over it, we checked the doc, the person in the wrong apologised, and we moved on.)

                </p>

                <p>
                    Then, of course, was the having sex with other people part. Flirting, texting, first kisses, new relationships are fun. Terrifying and nerve wrecking, but so fun. Why deprive myself of that? Someone once told me that by wanting a stable, loving relationship but also continuing to date other people and sleep around, I was trying to have my cake and eat it too. And yes, I absolutely am. What the f*ck is the point of having cake if I’m not going to eat it and savour every bite? 

                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, this isn’t to say that polyamory is all cakes and orgies all day long. It’s absolutely not. Poly takes hard work and endless communication with your partners. Because, contrary to popular belief, polyamorous people DO GET JEALOUS. Gasp horror, I know. Jealousy is the number one reason that people shy away from polyamory, or are convinced that they could never have an open relationship. “I’m a much too jealous person” is the response I get 99% of the time when I mention being polyamorous. I get jealous too. So jealous. Painfully jealous at times. But I had to learn to recognise that my jealousy is neither my partner’s fault, nor responsibility to fix. Jealousy is born of insecurity. So, I had to learn to recognise why I was feeling jealous- was I afraid my partner would enjoy sex more with someone else? That they’d fancy them more? That they were prettier/ funnier/ smarter (whatever it may be) than me? Then I’d have to work on this in myself, and also express it to my partner, so that he could meet me halfway by offering reassurance and making sure I knew that I was loved and cherished and sexy and all those good things. This level of emotional introspection and communication skills were not formed overnight, my partner and I worked for years to achieve this. To be honest, it’s still an ongoing learning curve for me.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I hope this has been of some insight to any of you out there who have never heard of polyamory, and to those of you who are practising ethical non-monogamy, I see you, and you’re killing it!
