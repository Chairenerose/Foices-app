                    By unlearning one's own ‘normative’ life patterns through this global pandemic, and
                    understanding the nuances of our
                    relational dynamics, this year has helped us gain clarity around our ever changing reality,
                    as we had to come to terms
                    with how our well being can fluctuate so easily and readily depending on each day of the
                    past year. As I come to terms
                    with what this year long pandemic meant for me, I have to acknowledge my own positionality
                    and privilege, knowing I had
                    a house to continue living in, and friends and family there to support me whatever the
                    circumstances.

                <p>
                    As I continued writing my MA thesis during the many lockdowns that happened, Lisa Bowleg’s
                    article <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305766">‘We’re
                        not all in
                        this together’</a>, led me to further understand the opposing effects of this global
                    lockdown. This article resonated with a number of
                    readers, seeing as Bowleg states that throughout history, these situations of global unrest
                    and anxiety caused by a
                    pandemic have produced statements of solidarity and uplifting claims, such as ‘we’re all in
                    this together’ - when in
                    reality “we could maintain the inequitable status quo and acknowledge “we’re all in this
                    together” for what it is:
                    another hollow platitude of solidarity designed to placate the privileged and temporarily
                    uncomfortable and
                    inconvenienced” (Bowleg, 2020). Understanding the historical and statistical nuances around
                    this term of solidarity also
                    led me to approach these times of introspection in an extremely realistic way, knowing how
                    polarized the effects of this
                    pandemic have become. My own experiences, have ultimately been moulded and influenced by my
                    own positionality, which is
                    ultimately one of privilege; as like many others, I thought of new hobbies to pick up during
                    the lockdown, what to cook
                    and bake, and how to keep up with friends and family during zoom calls and quizzes.

                    However, feelings of anxiety and loneliness were rife for countless family and friends
                    during this year - as my elders
                    had to isolate completely by themselves, following the strict measures of what the lockdown
                    entailed - unable to spend
                    time with anyone for months on end, and solely seeing faces across a computer screen. Hence,
                    with this March 2021
                    marking a year since the first lockdown in the Netherlands and across Europe, we wanted to
                    give thought and
                    consideration to what the past 12 months have meant for us, our writing, our growth, and
                    more importantly our relational
                    dynamics. Moving through this restless, yet simultaneously static, time I’ve understood not
                    only my position, as Bowleg
                    refers to within this system of “power and inequality which is structured for different
                    groups”, but the importance and
                    focality we have to place on unlearning these entrenched logics of ‘optimism and positivity’
                    (Bowleg, 2020). Because if
                    anything this past year has taught me that 2021 will not necessarily bring positive change
                    and prosperity and all those
                    other mantras for everyone, but it's just a continuation of the now, albeit with a different
                    number. So instead of
                    focusing on the what ifs, and constantly thinking about the next steps, I am just trying to
                    identify the dials I can
                    regulate myself; which ones I can direct, and knowing that I have the agency to actually do
                    so. The agency to resist, to
                    speak up, to know what battles are worth fighting for, and to ultimately be more present.
                    The past year with its ongoing
                    and relentless stream of headlines and news stories, has shown me, quite literally, that
                    being physically or virtually
                    here in the present is oftentimes the most critical thing to do. We are all living through
                    times of change and
                    continuous disquietude, and by being in the present moment (intentionally and at one's own
                    capacity) we are able to see
                    each turning point, each historical event happening before us. Realizing what it means to
                    actively see, to listen more,
                    to read, and to speak up.

                    Although at times, it is so easy to be readily saturated with streams of real-time
                    information, the last months of 2021
                    has shown me that finding an equilibrium between planning ahead in order to escape our
                    current reality - and also just
                    simply switching off sometimes (both your phone, your electronic devices, and your mental
                    capacity to carry every single
                    news headline that pops up each morning) is not only necessary, but it has constantly
                    reminded me of this relationality;
                    of reminding myself to be both present and absent - and again knowing which dials I can
                    direct myself.
