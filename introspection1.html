                <p>
                    The night of December 31st 2019, was a special night for everyone. A new decade awaited us
                    all, which many associated
                    with new beginnings and unrealistic promises. I was heavily affected by the latter.

                </p>

                <p>
                    As I savored my prosecco rosé, I wrote a letter to my future self, where I outlined
                    everything I wanted to accomplish by
                    the end of 2020. What began as a waltz between the current version of myself and the
                    powerful Michelle Obama—whom for
                    me, like many others is a constant source of inspiration. Ended with a list of dull goals,
                    any young lady who had been
                    heartbroken, gained a few pounds, or a victim of consumerism could have composed. Every goal
                    I had written had a theme
                    of self-transformation with the intent of receiving external validation. Little did I know
                    that my incapability of
                    smartly setting goals would not define 2020. Instead, it would be defined by a global
                    pandemic that not only interrupted
                    a normative routine/lifestyle for so many, but it further amplified racial and social
                    injustices through a racially
                    divisive lens.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I first caught wind of the pandemic and how my busy yet unfulfilling life was about to
                    change drastically, I was
                    delighted. It meant that I had an excuse to not keep up with my social circles. My relief
                    screamed 'privileged', whilst
                    many worried about job and food security; I embraced that the urgency of meeting my
                    commitments were gradually fading.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This time of solitude provided by the pandemic revealed the urgency to relearn how to live
                    for myself. Without a doubt,
                    I believed composing a new list of goals was the best way to approach this successfully.
                    However, this time, I decided
                    to write down everything that made me happy and enjoy life more.
                </p>

                <p>With the intent of being as honest as possible, my list illuminated that I was a food-loving,
                    reality tv admirer who
                    cared about making an impact on the world. I tackled this premature epitaph of myself by
                    doing each of the things on my
                    list within one week. Other than this approach being far from fulfilling, it was also
                    draining and exhausting.</p>

                <p>
                    As I enjoyed my banana brownies and listened to a <a
                        href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/women-of-impact/id1435217865">podcast</a> by
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/womenofimpact/">Women of Impact</a>, I realised that the
                    past week I had been
                    forcing myself to do 'joyful' things, making those things draining, as it felt like quite a
                    superficial approach to this
                    drastic change. My unsuccessful approach did not mean that I was out of touch with my
                    feelings; I just needed a break to
                    breathe and come to terms with myself.
                </p>

                <div class="text-image">
                    <img src="./Images/reflectionchair.png" id="reflectimage1">
                    <p><i>Image: My What Makes Me Happy List</i></p>
                </div>

                <p>It was time to integrate my essential self. The focus here was to review my life and
                    happiness triggers. After doing so,
                    I concluded that my 'what makes me happy' list was at surface level reflective of my
                    “goals”, that I wanted to achieve.
                    But looking back at it - this list like many others - reminded me of how unnecessary
                    and how out of touch those goals were with my true feelings, as I was suffering from
                    emotional exhaustion at the time of
                    writing it. By forcing myself to
                    activate my happy hormones, I was indirectly punishing myself for being sad. If this year
                    has taught me anything, it is
                    that it is okay not to be okay. Sometimes permitting yourself to let out your sadness is the
                    best way to trigger your
                    happiness.
