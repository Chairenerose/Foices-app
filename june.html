                            As I began writing this piece, I had to reckon with an ongoing relationality between
                            personal introspection and
                            historical research. There is so much active oppression in the world that it makes you
                            wonder if your cause is more
                            important than the cause of your peers. Unfortunately, minority groups worldwide are
                            impacted by oppression, when in
                            fact, we all deserve the right to equality, justice, dignity and freedom. One shouldn’t have
                            to fight for the spotlight.
                            Nevertheless, sometimes the spotlight skips a community, which is why it is up to
                            individuals to ensure that the stories
                            of their people are told. This is the story of Maluku.

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Maluku is a hidden tropical paradise that almost seems too good to be true. Maluku is an
                            archipelago above Australia,
                            next to West Papua and Timor-Leste. Please note that I purposely neglected to mention
                            Indonesia. The Maluku Islands have
                            been considered part of Oceania’s Melanesia region. Like the other regions of Oceania,
                            Maluku has beautiful reefs, empty
                            stretches of powdery white sand beaches, mountains and rainforests. With the Banda Sea,
                            Maluku has one of the deepest
                            seas globally, more than 7,000 meters deep. The Maluku Islands are also rich in natural
                            resources, such as gold and
                            petrol.
                        </p>

                        <p> The indigenous people of Maluku are called AlifURU, which means the first human (man and
                            woman). The AlifURU come from
                            NunuSaku - the birthplace of humankind - The first people left NunuSaku in groups, and their
                            descendants populated all
                            four corners of the earth. All nations evolved from the four Human Children and the four
                            human species, the white human,
                            the yellow human, the black human, and the <a href="www.nusaalifuru.org">brown human</a>. So
                            yes, we divided groups based on skin colour, but we never segregated communities based on
                            skin colour. Translated
                            into the contemporary, you can say that the indigenous people(s) of Maluku were the first to
                            practice inclusivity and
                            diversity.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Moreover, each island has maintained its traditions, beautiful tribe stories, culture and
                            language. Our way of life is
                            “Adat” ; There is one God, The Highest. Thus, our rights and obligations are established and
                            regulated according to this
                            principle. This includes the division of land, caring for our natural living environment,
                            and keeping a balanced life.
                            Furthermore, the Adat shows how to maintain relationships with different islands or tribe
                            clans. Therefore, we can feel
                            equally connected; we have always lived with diversity, peace and harmony.

                        </p>

                            Maluku was known as the Spice Islands between the 16th and 18th century. The islands were
                            the world’s only supplier of
                            nutmeg, cloves and mace. Back then, these spices were considered very vital and very
                            valuable trade commodities. The
                            search and subsequent fight for control of Maluku helped kick-start European colonialism.
                            Maluku was first exploited by
                            the Portuguese and then the Dutch. The arrival of the Dutch resulted in a significant
                            alteration in the social and
                            political landscape of Maluku.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As a result of colonialism, Maluku people know oppression like no other. That is why today,
                            we reflect on all the
                            injustice in the world. The world needs all the help it can to overcome the effects of
                            centuries of inequality and
                            oppression. That is why I am an advocate for

                                <i>Change The Future of Maluku</i>
                            </a>. A movement to raise awareness for equality, justice, dignity and freedom for the
                            people of Maluku.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Maluku, women have actively pushed forth calls for change and accountability. Two of our
                            heroes are Martha Christina
                            Tiahahu and Hansina Uktolseja. These two women stood up against colonial oppression and
                            aggression to free the Maluku
                            people. To enhance awareness for women’s rights in Maluku, I began a petition for our first
                            lady. She is considered the
                            mother of our people. Her name is Njonja Soumokil, and she still lives in exile in The
                            Netherlands. Her husband, Mr Dr
                            Christiaan Soumokil, was our president and a freedom fighter. He was unlawfully executed 55
                            years ago by an Indonesian
                            firing squad on the 12th of April 1966.

                            Mrs Soumokil has been looking for his grave ever since. However, her case entirely depends
                            on the Indonesian
                            government's willingness to make the location of the grave public. According to a Dutch
                            court ruling in 2018, the Dutch
                            government is obligated to investigate the exact location of her husband's grave. In order
                            to provide Mrs Soumokil with
                            the exact location of her husbands grave, a <a

                            has been made. To motivate the Dutch Government to apply more pressure on Indonesian
                            authorities to conform to international law.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The world needs to know that colonialism did not end simply because the Dutch left.
                            In 1949 after a war of independence, the Dutch ceded control of the archipelago. During the
                            decolonisation process,
                            Maluku leaders counselled the people. With the people's true will, they declared the
                            Republik Maluku Selatan (RMS)
                            independence on the 25th of April 1950. But this did not last long. Though the Dutch left,
                            they left their colonial
                            imprints behind, as their colonial roots provided the blueprint for Indonesia to take over
                            as an oppressor. More
                            specifically, to hold on to favourable trade relations.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Moreover, Indonesia invaded the capital island of Maluku, Ambon. Thus, the illegal
                            annexation of the RMS became real. As
                            a result of Indonesia's neo-colonialism, Maluku has been left in poverty and has prevented
                            any form of development
                            favouring the local population. Maluku is now a province of Indonesia and listed as the 4th
                            poorest province of
                            Indonesia's

                            I am here to learn, share lessons learned, overcome challenges and work together to thrive
                            through conversation. I want
                            the world to understand that neocolonialism still exists in various forms and locations.
                            Furthermore, I aim to explain
                            this by starting with the story of Maluku. We don’t have to fight over the spotlight, but we
                            must share the spotlight to
                            educate the world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Together we catalyse positive change by networking and funding the youth-led community human
                            rights movements and
                            liberation campaigns in Maluku. Focus on changing public opinion is essential to gain the
                            support of the international
                            community. It takes a lot of courage to stand against the oppressor, Indonesia, knowing
                            nobody is watching. At this
                            moment, dozens of peaceful Maluku activists face lifetime jail sentences because they raised
                            our flag. Razzias are held
                            randomly by the Indonesian State Army to arrest Maluku freedom fighters. In other words,
                            anyone who expresses a free
                            opinion, especially if it is politically oriented, is silenced.

                            support, the people in Maluku will be aware that they are not alone. The international
                            community is watching and

                                Dutch student associations are social organisations for Dutch college and university
                                students. It is common for these
                                student associations to be a home base for a collective group of sororities and
                                fraternities. For many students, joining
                                a student association can provide a home away from home. Thus, each year, thousands of
                                students are extremely eager to
                                follow a formal recruitment process in the hopes of pledging to a sorority or
                                fraternity.
                                Although being part of this
                                prestigious members-only community is rewarding, the exclusiveness of this community is
                                often misconstrued to be a
                                social organisation perpetuating a culture of toxicity.

                        <p>
                            When one does join a student association, their friends and family are often quick to judge
                            them, especially when that
                            individual does not fit the description of a “typical student association” member. These
                            initial
                            confused and carping
                            remarks are something Jazzmin Hoepel (23) is far too familiar with. Despite being born in
                            Limburg to a Dutch mother and
                            Surinamese father, she grew up in Utrecht, a part of two different worlds, growing up in a
                            multicultural neighbourhood
                            yet attended a posh public high school. It was clear that from a young age, Jazzmin knew how
                            to
                            adapt to new
                            environments. When Jazzmin joined the student association Plato in Tilburg in 2019 and
                            pledged
                            to the Sorority Amendus
                            Amandus, she had no trouble fully immersing herself in this social environment. Since then,
                            she
                            has joined various
                            committees at Plato and is currently a board member of the ‘Bodemdrift Festival’ organized
                            by
                            Amendus Amandus. Despite
                            the numerous opportunities provided to her, Jazzmin is often met with confusing gazes when
                            she
                            discloses her affiliation
                            to student associations. This is due to the general interpretation that student associations
                            are
                            for “rich white
                            families”. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Plato is a place where everyone is welcome. There is not necessarily one specific
                            demographic
                            that makes up the majority
                            of the association’s members. This eventually convinced Jazzmin to become a member.

                        </p>

                        <div class="quote">
                            <h4>“I was attracted to Plato as not everyone looked alike; in terms of colour, behaviour
                                and

                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Jazzmin was confident that she would fit right into an association where differences are
                            celebrated. Surprisingly, this
                            overly-optimistic outlook on student associations was first ominous when her friend shared
                            her
                            plans on joining a
                            student association three years ago. At that time, Jazzmin perceived student associations to
                            be
                            an unnecessary waste of
                            time, where forced friendships are glorified. It follows that many share these biased
                            perceptions of student
                            associations. A range of factors has fuelled the construction of these stereotypes. Starting
                            with past tragedies that
                            highlight the dark side of these associations, to the role television series such as <a
                                href="https://www.bnnvara.nl/feuten"><i>Feuten</i></a> and <a
                                href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80995039">Ares</a> have played
                            where
                            problematic aspects of Dutch student association life is both glorified and mocked.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Furthermore, student associations are often segregated from the general community in these
                            student cities. Thus,
                            judgements are effortlessly made. As the exclusivity of these associations leaves the public
                            with limited information
                            about them. Therefore, to understand these groups, they are categorized according to the
                            labels
                            provided to the public.
                            For instance, what is showcased by the media. This simplification of the unknown is what
                            leads
                            to the construction of
                            generalized stigmas of Dutch student associations.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The result of this bubble that has been formed around Dutch student associations across
                            cities
                            in the Netherlands is
                            that they have become a community of their own. Despite the numerous associations in
                            multiple
                            cities, they all
                            understand each other to some extent. This exclusion has generated a general opinion that
                            student associations are only
                            for a specific race, size and class. What has further triggered this presumption is that
                            student
                            associations are
                            predominantly white. Thus, associations are often accused of excluding non-white races from
                            these societies. In addition
                            to that, there have been numerous tragedies where students from non-white backgrounds have
                            experienced racial
                            discrimination within these associations. Understanding the lack of multiculturalism within
                            these associations is not as
                            easy as the public presumes it is.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Having been a member for more than a year, Jazzmin believes Dutch student associations are
                            currently open to all
                            prospective students. However, a particular demographic of students are most likely to
                            express
                            their interest in them.
                            Usually, these students already know before enrolling in university that pledging to a
                            sorority
                            or fraternity is
                            essential to experiencing the best type of student life. In addition, the financial position
                            of
                            an individual or their
                            family also plays a role, as “joining a student association is just an expensive joke”,
                            seeing
                            as being part of an
                            association can cost you hundreds of euros. This may insinuate that students who are
                            second-generation immigrants to the
                            Netherlands don’t necessarily have the goal of joining a student association as their number
                            one
                            priority during
                            university.

                        </p>

                        <div class="quote">
                            <h4>“I have witnessed it myself in my neighbourhood that is predominantly inhabited with
                                immigrants. There isn’t much talk
                                of sororities”
                            </h4>

                        <p>
                            This provided a sharp difference from the general conversations at her high school, where
                            many
                            of her classmates were
                            impressed by student associations, probably due to the privileges of being a native.
                            Ultimately,
                            Jazzmin advocates that
                            it is crucial to bear in mind that “one’s environment has a lot of influence on the choices
                            one
                            makes without even
                            noticing it at that moment”.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1936724420947010"><i>homophily
                                    effect</i></a> clarifies why students are so often attracted to social
                            organisations that resemble their
                            characteristics. Being around others with similar values, attitudes, behaviours, or even
                            being
                            of the same race can
                            increase one’s comfort level in social situations. This theory offers another reason as to
                            why
                            student associations are
                            predominantly white. When questioned on race in student associations, Jazzmin acted in
                            congruence with this theory,
                        </p>

                        <div class="quote">
                            <h4>“it just attracts you faster when you identify with the image a student association
                                portrays”
                            </h4>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Nonetheless, this simplified explanation of why Dutch student associations look the way they
                            do
                            is often not accepted by
                            the public. Associations often face criticism for their diversity and inclusion efforts.
                            Jazzmin
                            vehemently disagrees;
                            on the contrary, she believes that “it has to happen naturally” and offers another solution
                            in
                            which associations could
                            dedicate more time to inclusive representation on their social media and event posters. This
                            tactic may reach a more
                            diverse audience, as it’s easier to identify with someone who looks like you than someone
                            who
                            doesn’t look like you.
                        </p>

                        <p>Diversity is what subconsciously influenced Jazzmin to pledge to the sorority Amendus
                            Amandus.
                            Although she immediately

                            Her intuition was on point as, since then, she has formed long-lasting friendships and is
                            “happy
                            to be there, especially
                            in a city where you don’t know anyone”. Although her experience at Plato and AA has been
                            nothing
                            short of remarkable, as
                            she is fully immersed in this student life, Jazzmin is fully aware that she is the only
                            black
                            friend for some of her
                            student association friends, which for Jazzmin is both a gift and a curse.

                            Though, to make her feel included, Jazzmin has sometimes had to hear that her peers don’t
                            see
                            colour. This dismissal of
                            racial identity may have been done with the right intentions, yet her reaction to this
                            statement
                            was toe-curling. As
                            “colours are there to be seen and not to be ignored ”. Unfortunately, Jazzmin has also
                            experienced these insensitive
                            situations in which stereotypical jokes are made. She assumes that the students who have
                            made
                            these remarks probably
                            find the jokes acceptable, as they are not about her. This has left her to wonder if her
                            presence or the relationships
                            she has formed in the association is the only reason she is not targeted by these jokes.

                        <p>
                            It goes to say that Jazzmin is fully aware of the controversies surrounding Dutch student
                            associations. That being said,
                            she has been fortunate enough not to be a victim of these tragedies. She is grateful for the
                            opportunities Plato has
                            provided her and the new skills she has developed. Finally, she acknowledges the privilege
                            she
                            has as a black girl in a
                            Dutch student association and hopes to attract a more diverse group of students in the
                            coming
                            years.

                        <p>Love is Love. That's the motto of our community. Yet love, even within our modern times, is
                            still such a controversial
                            term. Being gay and being able to love and be loved is still not allowed and a problem in
                            many countries. As a Persian,
                            I am aware of how socially conservative societies can make it extremely challenging for one
                            to live their truth.

                            Being bullied, mistreated and discriminated against are a few of the common intolerant

                            daily. We have to tolerate many things. It could be the weird faces people make when you
                            walk hand in hand with someone
                            else, the insensitive questions other people ask, or if it is the way you have been taught
                            in school that only men and
                            women are allowed to love each other.

                            It doesn’t even affect me any more if somebody calls me ‘f*ggot“ or comments some bible
                            verse under my Instagram profile
                            telling me how being gay will send me to hell. Not only that, but it is a part of my life,
                            which I was forced to adapt
                            to. Many of our community had to adapt to the hatred of the people and accept it because it
                            is easier than to change
                            those people’s mindset.

                        <p>
                            For people not in my skin, being gay seems so easy, as they have never been confronted with
                            all the issues that come
                            with the colourful rainbow. Moreover, even within the rainbow, there is still a lot of room
                            for improvement as
                            discrimination and racism also extend to our rows.

                            Nevertheless, I am thankful for pride month, as it raises awareness about the people who
                            have been mistreated for
                            decades. Pride reminds me that my existence is valid and provides understanding to younger
                            people who still struggle
                            with their identity to understand that the possibility of being different exists. I am
                            looking very forward to the
                            future of our community. I am thankful to know that the coming generations have to face less
                            injustice as previous
                            generations did.

                            One of the main reasons F-OICE-S aims to provide a feminist lens to critical readings of our
                            contemporary setting is
                            based on the constant interactions with heteronormative and hegemonic structures that women
                            face.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I use the term heteronormative matrix here, as defined by North-America philosopher and
                            gender theorist Judith Butler,
                            as "the metaphor of the matrix is a system of externally imposed rules with an understanding
                            of how the matrix – to the
                            extent that it exists – relies on hegemony as organised consent." Butler refers to the
                            matrix as a fixed hegemonic
                            system between genders, sexuality, and heteronormative tropes surrounding masculinity and
                            femininity. Wherein
                            masculinity has been shaped and moulded based on the power structures that have arisen from
                            centuries of patriarchal
                            lines of governance. With governance here meaning a manner of governing a state,
                            organization, but also the governance
                            of social milieus and relational dynamics.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This sense of patriarchal governance is present within our everyday contextual interactions:
                            from being told that 'you
                            run like a girl', or to 'man up' by forcing one to suppress emotional reactions all
                            together.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In effect, four different women working in the Dutch music industry, within different record
                            labels, shared their own
                            respective experiences as a female in this male-dominated industry. A commonality between
                            some of these interviews was
                            that some women automatically felt that they became set into roles, values, and
                            stereotypical feminine tropes within
                            these spaces. This stems from a long history of women being treated as property to men, and
                            the idea that men can
                            control, dictate, and directly influence how a woman should lead her life.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I believe the anonymous stories submitted to us from women working in a predominantly white,
                            Dutch, male institution
                            correlates towards this notion of how in almost every institutional space, there is a
                            prevailing sense of hegemony based
                            on your own gender identity.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These conversations go further than just speaking about a 'boys club'. They are heavily
                            linked with how historical modes
                            of production, in a capitalist market within our current contextual setting in Western
                            Europe, still stem from the idea
                            that there is a gendered division of labour. In this division, women have constantly been
                            anchored to a relation of
                            servitude, from the 'nuclear family' home, to their depiction across almost every form of
                            mainstream media as either
                            secondarily tied to a main male character, or as this figure of care and nurture. Thus, it
                            is necessary to acknowledge
                            how this historical positionality still interferes with workplace dynamics in our
                            contemporary setting, as the status of
                            these women in this industry is still coated with nature-like inexorability. From being
                            perceived as just an object, a
                            caterer, submissive, quiet and unable to speak out about what they feel is unequal, unjust,
                            and wrong in this industry.

                            Hence, the toxic culture that still roams in the record label industry has left four women
                            that we interviewed to wonder
                            whether a job at a record label, their sub-labels or external label service agencies is
                            right for them. The initial
                            consensus among these women was that working at a record label or sub-agency would develop
                            their professional aptitude
                            and lead them to better career opportunities in this industry. Furthermore, getting insight
                            into artists’ work and
                            exclusive access to these spaces also had its attractive qualities. Over time, these views
                            transposed to frustration and
                            general resentment towards the ‘old boys club’ at their workplace. For some of these women,
                            having to deal with
                            bothersome comments daily, often concerning feminine stereotypes, has left them to feel
                            undervalued and often put aside
                            if they were to make a complaint.

                            Furthermore, in fast-paced industries, such as record labels, mistakes are bound to occur,
                            which is why workplaces must
                            embrace failure and grow from them. Unfortunately, for these women, working in this
                            male-dominated industry, the
                            attitude towards failure is pernicious and pervasive. They also stated that it is common for
                            their mistakes to trigger
                            irrational reactions. Moreover, one respondent shared that more leniency is shown towards
                            her male colleagues. On the
                            contrary, their male colleagues’ mistakes are often put off, and due to this ‘enabling’
                            culture, their mistakes are also
                            less readily admitted. As a result, there is this inequality of discipline, where female
                            employees responsible for
                            trivial to minor missteps are subject to far worse penalties than male colleagues.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This inequality of discipline can often leave them to wonder about their job security. More
                            specifically, whether their
                            job is worth the stress and trauma. The survey we made, showed that there is a correlation
                            between toxic workplace
                            culture and job satisfaction. Highlighting the necessity for these record labels to dedicate
                            time to enacting policies,
                            which ensure and maintain an equal and respectful working environment. Wherein, record
                            labels can demonstrate that
                            gender diversity is a high priority and implement policies that foster an inclusive culture.

                            Never Normal records, thus, provides the space for the possibility to deconstruct these
                            gendered power dynamics within
                            an industry that is deeply misogynistic.

                            Finally, the status of women in the record label industry is obscure. Their voices are often
                            muted, and their demands
                            often disregarded, despite women bringing so much to the table. Furthermore, the history of
                            women in leadership
                            positions at record labels demonstrates how their presence influences change and contributes
                            to profitable returns for
                            the music economy. Therefore, honest conversations about gender inclusion in the workplace
                            must be encouraged, as this
                            may retain female talent in this fast-paced industry.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thus, part of this ongoing conversation that we are trying to have is also rooted in the
                            inability to contest this
                            gendered power dynamic, for it feels like things won't change, or these voices will never be
                            heard. Yet, F-OICE-S aim to
                            centre these voices to deconstruct hegemonic power structures rooted in gendered divisions
                            across institutional
                            landscapes.
