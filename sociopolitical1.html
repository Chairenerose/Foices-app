                    For many, the pandemic provided us with the opportunity to take care of ourselves. As well
                    as change our lives for the
                    better. From venturing into a new career to adopting a healthy lifestyle, many have used
                    this time at home to reevaluate
                    their priorities and replace sabotaging habits with propitious ones. ‘Reinventing’ your life
                    by making
                    (personal/individual) changes has become quite popular during the pandemic and sharing those
                    personal reinventions
                    online has become a consequent effect of the public visibility these platforms provide. From
                    drastic weight loss videos
                    to sharing the process of great business ideas that pivoted during the pandemic; social
                    media has become the most
                    favoured platform for sharing success and receiving feedback, congratulations, or approval
                    in return.



                </p>

                <p>
                    Honor Whiteman explains in <a
                        href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/275361">MedicalNewsToday</a> the
                    direct
                    impact profit-based and accessible
                    digital social platforms have
                    on our mental health and what makes them so addicting. The report reveals that social media
                    can create negative
                    behaviour patterns and influence how users perceive themselves, affecting their overall
                    confidence. Whiteman suggests
                    that the relational link between social media and our contemporary context are mutually
                    constitutive with the need to
                    belong and relate to this electronic domain, thus this platform, albeit with its pros and
                    cons, has become the
                    perpetrator for this addiction to wanting to 'relate and belong, to the majority (Whiteman,
                    2015). He further states
                    that the rise in popularity and visibility of uploading 'fitness transformation' videos,
                    though sometimes motivating,
                    could stem from us wanting to mitigate negative emotions created from making romanticized
                    comparisons with others'
                    idealized online versions of themselves. The problem here is that the use of social media
                    has become irrational and
                    excessive, allowing for this comparative dynamic, between us and what we are seeing, to turn
                    into a destructive domino
                    effect. Thus, leading it to interfere massively with our daily lives.

                <p>
                    We, as a society, are very visual. Hence, transformation videos with the most noticeable
                    improvements are likely to
                    receive the most online praise. Although online praise may be initially satisfying, the
                    impulse and or growing
                    inclination to amplify online/digital recognition based on the most drastic transformation
                    journeys - through videos or
                    pictures - can become one of the main driving factors towards self-sabotaging behaviour. For
                    instance, taking extreme
                    measures to achieve drastic weight loss, followed by the sharing of that achievement online
                    with the hopes of receiving
                    a multitude of praise. When I look at myself, there is evidence of allowing positive body
                    transformation videos to
                    trigger negative emotions. Those triggers eventually correlate to the growth of participants
                    in extreme weight loss
                    challenges. And the decline of individuals adopting more sustainable and healthy habits that
                    may result in slow weight
                    loss, which is more tenable both for oneself and the unlearning of these destructive weight
                    loss habits.

                </div>

                <p>
                    My approach to achieving extreme weight loss is an example of how the viral trend of sharing
                    self-improvement videos may
                    influence individuals to adopt an intangible lifestyle. Emphasising the importance of
                    considering your intent before
                    embarking on a journey that may transform your life. It is clear to me that the next time I
                    contemplate developing a
                    fitness mindset and changing my body, I should clarify the intentions I want to set for
                    myself. Whether they are rooted
                    in simply feeling better, to start eating healthier, or whether they are a product of
                    external (societal) pressure. By
                    clarifying my intentions, I may understand the end results better and identify the end
                    beneficiaries. It is vital to
                    establish the end beneficiaries of your goals as by doing so, if, for instance,if you are
                    not one of the beneficiaries,
                    achieving that goal may leave an unfulfilling inkling.
