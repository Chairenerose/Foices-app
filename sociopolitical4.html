                    One of the main reasons F-OICE-S aims to provide a feminist lens to critical readings of our
                    contemporary setting is
                    based on the constant interactions with heteronormative and hegemonic structures that women
                    face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I use the term heteronormative matrix here, as defined by North-America philosopher and
                    gender theorist Judith Butler,
                    as "the metaphor of the matrix is a system of externally imposed rules with an understanding
                    of how the matrix – to the
                    extent that it exists – relies on hegemony as organised consent." Butler refers to the
                    matrix as a fixed hegemonic
                    system between genders, sexuality, and heteronormative tropes surrounding masculinity and
                    femininity. Wherein
                    masculinity has been shaped and moulded based on the power structures that have arisen from
                    centuries of patriarchal
                    lines of governance. With governance here meaning a manner of governing a state,
                    organization, but also the governance
                    of social milieus and relational dynamics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This sense of patriarchal governance is present within our everyday contextual interactions:
                    from being told that 'you
                    run like a girl', or to 'man up' by forcing one to suppress emotional reactions all
                    together.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In effect, four different women working in the Dutch music industry, within different record
                    labels, shared their own
                    respective experiences as a female in this male-dominated industry. A commonality between
                    some of these interviews was
                    that some women automatically felt that they became set into roles, values, and
                    stereotypical feminine tropes within
                    these spaces. This stems from a long history of women being treated as property to men, and
                    the idea that men can
                    control, dictate, and directly influence how a woman should lead her life.

                </p>

                <p>
                    I believe the anonymous stories submitted to us from women working in a predominantly white,
                    Dutch, male institution
                    correlates towards this notion of how in almost every institutional space, there is a
                    prevailing sense of hegemony based
                    on your own gender identity.

                </p>

                <p>
                    These conversations go further than just speaking about a 'boys club'. They are heavily
                    linked with how historical modes
                    of production, in a capitalist market within our current contextual setting in Western
                    Europe, still stem from the idea
                    that there is a gendered division of labour. In this division, women have constantly been
                    anchored to a relation of
                    servitude, from the 'nuclear family' home, to their depiction across almost every form of
                    mainstream media as either
                    secondarily tied to a main male character, or as this figure of care and nurture. Thus, it
                    is necessary to acknowledge
                    how this historical positionality still interferes with workplace dynamics in our
                    contemporary setting, as the status of
                    these women in this industry is still coated with nature-like inexorability. From being
                    perceived as just an object, a
                    caterer, submissive, quiet and unable to speak out about what they feel is unequal, unjust,
                    and wrong in this industry.

                The Future of Young Women

                <p>

                    Although it is undeniable why ensuring equal representation of women in the workplace can
                    change company dynamics for
                    the better, within the music industry in the Netherlands, women remain marginalized through
                    exclusionary career
                    advancing spaces, hostile sexism; including generalized assumptions that any type of musical
                    instrument or sound
                    engineering/sound recording techniques are "<a
                        href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327109686_Gender_Politics_in_the_Music_Industry">too
                        advanced for women</a>".

                </p>

                <p>
                    Hence, the toxic culture that still roams in the record label industry has left four women
                    that we interviewed to wonder
                    whether a job at a record label, their sub-labels or external label service agencies is
                    right for them. The initial
                    consensus among these women was that working at a record label or sub-agency would develop
                    their professional aptitude
                    and lead them to better career opportunities in this industry. Furthermore, getting insight
                    into artists’ work and
                    exclusive access to these spaces also had its attractive qualities. Over time, these views
                    transposed to frustration and
                    general resentment towards the ‘old boys club’ at their workplace. For some of these women,
                    having to deal with
                    bothersome comments daily, often concerning feminine stereotypes, has left them to feel
                    undervalued and often put aside
                    if they were to make a complaint.

                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, in fast-paced industries, such as record labels, mistakes are bound to occur,
                    which is why workplaces must
                    embrace failure and grow from them. Unfortunately, for these women, working in this
                    male-dominated industry, the
                    attitude towards failure is pernicious and pervasive. They also stated that it is common for
                    their mistakes to trigger
                    irrational reactions. Moreover, one respondent shared that more leniency is shown towards
                    her male colleagues. On the
                    contrary, their male colleagues’ mistakes are often put off, and due to this ‘enabling’
                    culture, their mistakes are also
                    less readily admitted. As a result, there is this inequality of discipline, where female
                    employees responsible for
                    trivial to minor missteps are subject to far worse penalties than male colleagues.

                </p>

                <p>
                    This inequality of discipline can often leave them to wonder about their job security. More
                    specifically, whether their
                    job is worth the stress and trauma. The survey we made, showed that there is a correlation
                    between toxic workplace
                    culture and job satisfaction. Highlighting the necessity for these record labels to dedicate
                    time to enacting policies,
                    which ensure and maintain an equal and respectful working environment. Wherein, record
                    labels can demonstrate that
                    gender diversity is a high priority and implement policies that foster an inclusive culture.

                </p>

                <p>Although this may sound impossible considering how white and male most record labels are, <a

                        Normal Soundsystem</a> in 2014. As stated in her interview with <a

                    her aversion to toxic working environments she encountered within most record labels - where
                    she felt tokenized,
                </p>

                <div class="quote">
                    <h4>“Led me to found Never Normal, a place for kids who grew up listening to everything —

                        couple labels doing this, and they
                        were so male. They were just so male! I knew where I stood, I knew what I felt, and I
                        really went with my vibe.”

                    Never Normal records, thus, provides the space for the possibility to deconstruct these
                    gendered power dynamics within
                    an industry that is deeply misogynistic.

                <p>
                    Finally, the status of women in the record label industry is obscure. Their voices are often
                    muted, and their demands
                    often disregarded, despite women bringing so much to the table. Furthermore, the history of
                    women in leadership
                    positions at record labels demonstrates how their presence influences change and contributes
                    to profitable returns for
                    the music economy. Therefore, honest conversations about gender inclusion in the workplace
                    must be encouraged, as this
                    may retain female talent in this fast-paced industry.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus, part of this ongoing conversation that we are trying to have is also rooted in the
                    inability to contest this
                    gendered power dynamic, for it feels like things won't change, or these voices will never be
                    heard. Yet, F-OICE-S aim to
                    centre these voices to deconstruct hegemonic power structures rooted in gendered divisions
                    across institutional
                    landscapes.
