                        “In feminist theory, the male gaze is the act of depicting women in the visual arts and in literature, from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as sexual objects for the pleasure of the heterosexual male viewer. The concept was first used by the English art critic John Berger in Ways of Seeing, as part of his analysis of the treatment of women as objects in advertising and nudes in European painting. It soon became popular among feminist theorists, including the British film critic Laura Mulvey, who used it to critique traditional media representations of the female character in cinema, and coined the phrase.”

                    When I talk about Cher, Madonna, and Janet Jackson, they usually come up in conversation with friends as literal icons that have shaped and moulded contemporary pop culture as we know it. With Cher's 'I am a rich man' interview snippet from the 80s, to Madonna's pop star legacy as the queen of pop and Janet Jackson's chart-topping hits; all three women have paved the way for contemporary artists, musicians, models, and creatives. From jaw-dropping runway looks; like Cher’s completely sheer beaded gown with white feathered sleeves and a white feathered skirt at the Met Gala in 1974, to Madonna’s timeless 80s red lip + bushy eyebrow makeup look.

                    I've chosen to speak about these three icons, not only because of how they continue to influence contemporary visual culture, from fashion to makeup to art direction in music videos. But because they can be studied through different theories of iconoclasm: seeing as all three of them assertively rejected cherished beliefs and institutions, along with established heteronormative values and practices within the music and performance industry. An example of this being that Cher actively rejected antiquated societal standards when it came to her showing her tattoos publicly, during a time when inked skin still had a bad reputation. She never let anyone else’s opinion hold her back from doing what she wanted to do for herself. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Notwithstanding, these figures, and their respective public images, have been moulded and shaped by the male gaze. Seeing as the performance industry has been built upon the objectification of the female figure, as the submissive, sultry, and sexy ‘object’ that can remain voiceless. Yet, always cater to male desires through their body and their appearance, which has subsequently set up unrealistic body standards for both men and women. With men thinking that women retain an ability to look a certain way for the pleasure of men, and for women to receive a constant stream of imagery of beauty standards built upon this objectified view marketed to them as how a ‘desirable’ woman should look and behave. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    Yet, these three icons have been able to break away from this objectified entrapment by claiming their own agency and power over their brand image; through personal interviews, music videos produced and directed by them, tweets, Instagram posts and a series of introspective projects that delve deeper into their personal stories, and no longer rest solely on the surface of their physical appearance.

                    Janet Jackson led her own rebranding in order to separate herself from her family name in an extremely effective way by establishing herself as a mononym. She tackled sexual intimacy with an empowered stance reflective of her Control and Rhythm Nation era, which asserted her independence and social justice leanings. In her nineties' rebirth, her song ‘Janet’ explored everything from foreplay to oral sex. She maintained that an active sex life does not deter a woman from being a role model figure, and she placed a heavy emphasis on safe sex in her visuals. Thus, with her music production and visuals, she heavily influenced other female stars to become more openly sexual, due to the confidence, sexual agency and ownership Janet exuded and demanded for herself. Because of Janet, the 90s was the beginning of a new era, where sex and sexuality could move to the centre of the pop-music conversation and more importantly it allowed Janet to push boundaries not only for herself, but for her other female peers.

                <p>
                    It is important to note how each of these stars had different timelines with regard to their rise to fame, and how each of them were seen as the first to shatter the standardized rules set out for female artists. Each one of them ensured that their voice and visuals reflected their real desires, completely unapologetic about their sexuality and sensuality. Yet, Janet's career took a 180-turn when Justin Timberlake tore off part of her costume, revealing her nipple at the Super Bowl Half-time Show in 2004. The show was produced by MTV that year, and for the split second that Janet was assaulted it generated

                        "A domino effect that made Janet Jackson the most-searched person and term of 2004 and 2005. The incident broke the record for "most-searched event over one day". It became the most-watched, recorded and replayed television moment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo"><i>TiVo</i></a> history and "enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo] 
                        subscribers to sign up". The term "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardrobe_malfunction">wardrobe malfunction</a>" was coined as a result of the incident, 
                        and was eventually added to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s_Dictionary">Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</a>".

                <p>
                    The many theories surrounding this incident of the show suggest how it was pre-planned by Timberlake to create this objectifying and shaming gaze around Janet by violently exposing her body. Thus, upholding a continuous power dynamic between the objectifying male gaze – which has always been mutually constituted in a patriarchal system that controls the music and pop culture industry to this day. This incident caused Janet’s career to become the centre of attention and formed an extremely invasive lens onto her public image and body. Completely removing her agency over how her own body was ‘searched’ up and viewed by the world. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    However, Cher, Madonna, and Janet Jackson have in many ways built their own narrative in which their own bodies, voices, and 'brand image' fight against the double standard that encourages men to express their sexual interests in an invasive and completely uninterrupted way, yet demands a woman to suppress hers in any way shape or form. Where female sexuality is only ever catered to the public eye in relation to the male gaze. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    What these three icons have created for themselves now is the ‘blueprint’ for artists like Doja Cat, Saweetie, Ariana Grande and so many others. Janet, Madonna and Cher have effectively set the standard for the OG 'hot girl' – a phrase coined by Megan Thee Stallion as a woman who owns her sexuality, prowess, independence, whilst always maintaining her own values and respect for her other female peers. In Megan's own words, 'it really is easier to be nice than to be mean' and her confidence is symbiotic with this statement of being inclusive of all women who feel confident in themselves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By continuing to reference Cher, Madonna, and Janet Jackson whenever we speak about music, clubbing culture, fashion/makeup looks, runway looks and art direction, it’s crystal clear how each of these stars have built up their own legacy and how it continues to thrive in the contemporary- with, for instance, the collaborative mentorship project between Saweetie and Cher that has influenced Saweetie’s album production and visuals. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    This relationality between these icons and contemporary pop culture is not only evident in the way other upcoming female artists are reclaiming their space within the industry, but also in how women from different demographics in our contemporary setting are determined to remain unapologetic, unfiltered and defiant in regard to how they want to express their sexuality or not. Whether that be through fashion, makeup, dance, music, modelling, and any other outlet which allows them to be confident and assertive, by completely rejecting the standard ‘mould’ that has been built up for centuries by the male gaze.
