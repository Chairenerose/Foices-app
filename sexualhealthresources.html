                <p id="general-disclaimer-sex">  <strong>General disclaimer:</strong> The stigma surrounding STD’s/STI’s and getting tested for them stems
                     both from general misinformation in sexual health education, 
                     and in some cases the complete lack of sexual health education 
                     in our contemporary setting. We still lack accessible information 
                     and education surrounding sexual health, and it’s vital to start openly talking 
                     about the normalcy of getting tested, whether you are sexually active or not. 
                     Getting tested can seem so daunting and anxiety inducing, and 
                     from personal experience it always helps to ask close friends for support/advice. 
                     Yet sexual health clinics are there to provide you with all 
                     the correct information about contraception, getting tested, 
                     consensual sex, and so much more.  
                     These clinics provide a safe space for you to ask any sort of question, 
                     where you can feel heard, and most importantly safe. Sexual health clinics also provide a space where you can break down stigmas 
                     about STI’s/STD’s, and choose the best way for you to have safe and protected sex.  <br/> <br /> 
                    
                     Not all clinics worldwide provide these safe spaces, but with this list we aim
                    to highlight the resources that provide these services in the Netherlands.
