                <p>The series <i>Red Lotus</i> by<a href="https://kamonlaksukchai.org/"> Kamonlak Sukchai </a> reinterprets different scenes 
                    from a Buddhist myth that “speaks about a female deity who ‘loses’ her ‘purity’ due to her promiscuity and passion. After being sacrificed to the gods, she is reincarnated as a red lotus”. 
                    With the Red <i>Lotus</i> series, Sukchai is interested in how these mythical tales can be controlled to further influence contemporary discourse. This series aims to establish how a woman displaying her sexuality is often seen as a transgressive act.

                            I want to preface this piece by saying that I am by no means an expert in polyamory, all I know is what I’ve read, learned online and experienced myself as a polyamorous person. If you want to take a deeper look in to what ethical non-monogamy entails, check out these Instagram pages:

                            Alternatively, I would recommend reading '<a>The Ethical Slut</a>' by Dossie Easton and Janet W. Hardy, 
                            and <a href="https://www.morethantwo.com/">'More Than Two’</a> by Eve Rickert and Franklin Veaux. My partner and I read both of these books together before we embarked on our own polyamorous adventure, and we definitely wouldn’t have managed so well without them!

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A lot of the language used in ethical non-monogamy is either brand new to some people, or else they have different understanding of terms, so I’m going to begin by sharing my own definitions of a few key things, so we’re all on the same page. (This isn’t to say I came up with the definitions, this is just how I understand them.)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Monogamy</strong> - the practice of having only one partner, or feelings for one person, at a time. This is the most common relationship structure found in modern western society. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Open relationships/ ethical non-monogamy</strong> - – This is an umbrella term for any relationship that isn’t strictly ‘monogamous.’ Open relationships vary between partners- anything from being able to kiss strangers on a night out, to having full-blown relationships with more than one person, fall under the ethical non- monogamy umbrella. Why ethical? Because ALL PARTIES have to be fully informed and consenting of the relationship structure. Otherwise, it’s cheating. 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Cheating</strong> Non-ethical monogamy. One or more partners are either unaware or non-consenting of the open nature of the relationship. YES, you can have cheating in polyamory. NO, polyamory and cheating are not “basically the same thing”. Consent is key. Always. 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Polygamory ('poly)</strong> - Falls under the ethical non-monogamy umbrella. Polyamorous people can have feelings for more than one person at a time, and may have more than one partner at any given moment. Poly people are still polyamorous even when they are single. Much as a gay person is still gay even if they are single. You can delve further into this in the resources I have shared above, but that’s the basics for now. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Polygamy</strong> - The practice of having more than one WIFE at a time. i.e. one husband with five sister wives. This is a cultural and religious practice seen in many parts of the world; however, it is not synonymous with polyamory, as it does not recognise the woman’s* right to have multiple partners.
                        </p>

                        <p>*<i>I have tried to keep my language as inclusive as possible. I recognise that womxn is usually the ‘inclusive’ term for ‘women’, but as trans and female-identifying individuals are women, I see no reason to differentiate the terms.
                        </i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, please note that relationships don’t have to be sexual or romantic in nature. Many a-sexual and a-romantic individuals are drawn to ethical non-monogamy as it allows them to have non-platonic partnerships, while giving their non- asexual/ aromantic partner the opportunity to find sexual/romantic fulfilment elsewhere. 
 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Now that we’re all on the same page, I can give you a little insight in to my own polyamorous experience. 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I have had three long-term relationships in my life. Two of those were monogamous and the last was poly. Although I enjoyed both of my monogamous relationships, I always felt somewhat trapped by the societal norms and structures that were forced on me as soon as I entered into a monogamous partnership. It’s not just not being able to sleep with other people, but the possessiveness that conventional monogamy teaches us. WHY does cutting myself off from all other avenues of non-platonic love demonstrate how much I care for someone? WHY does touching your genitals and no one else’s for the rest of eternity prove that I am a good and loyal partner? What is with these random rules on how to ‘correctly’ love someone? Surely the gauge of a good partner should be measured in support given, healthy communication and mutual respect? I can give my partners all of those things and flirt with the cute barista at my local coffee shop. 
 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For me, polyamory offered the opportunity to tailor my relationships to me and my partners. There were no preconceived rules to follow, we could decide exactly what was allowed and what wasn’t. For example, were we even allowed to sleep with other people? (we were), did we want to know if our partner had slept with somebody else (we did), did we have to use a condom with new partners (we did), was oral sex allowed (it was)- anything you can imagine, we decided on it. In fact, we even had a Google doc where we wrote down things we discussed, so if one of us slipped up we could go back and see what we had agreed. (For example, we had an agreement that we wouldn’t kiss or go home with someone else while we were both at the same party. One of us forgot and the other got upset about it, so instead of arguing over it, we checked the doc, the person in the wrong apologised, and we moved on.)

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Then, of course, was the having sex with other people part. Flirting, texting, first kisses, new relationships are fun. Terrifying and nerve wrecking, but so fun. Why deprive myself of that? Someone once told me that by wanting a stable, loving relationship but also continuing to date other people and sleep around, I was trying to have my cake and eat it too. And yes, I absolutely am. What the f*ck is the point of having cake if I’m not going to eat it and savour every bite? 
 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, this isn’t to say that polyamory is all cakes and orgies all day long. It’s absolutely not. Poly takes hard work and endless communication with your partners. Because, contrary to popular belief, polyamorous people DO GET JEALOUS. Gasp horror, I know. Jealousy is the number one reason that people shy away from polyamory, or are convinced that they could never have an open relationship. “I’m a much too jealous person” is the response I get 99% of the time when I mention being polyamorous. I get jealous too. So jealous. Painfully jealous at times. But I had to learn to recognise that my jealousy is neither my partner’s fault, nor responsibility to fix. Jealousy is born of insecurity. So, I had to learn to recognise why I was feeling jealous- was I afraid my partner would enjoy sex more with someone else? That they’d fancy them more? That they were prettier/ funnier/ smarter (whatever it may be) than me? Then I’d have to work on this in myself, and also express it to my partner, so that he could meet me halfway by offering reassurance and making sure I knew that I was loved and cherished and sexy and all those good things. This level of emotional introspection and communication skills were not formed overnight, my partner and I worked for years to achieve this. To be honest, it’s still an ongoing learning curve for me.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I hope this has been of some insight to any of you out there who have never heard of polyamory, and to those of you who are practising ethical non-monogamy, I see you, and you’re killing it!

                        <p>
                            Main, side, drink. What does that mean to you? A set meal? Or a set of men? Your main guy, side guy, 
                            and the guy you message on drunk nights for hook-ups. Pre-pandemic, I had all of them, one guy for every occasion, 
                            one for the type of company I wanted that day. Needless to say, I was occupied and extremely 
                            satisfied, what can I say? I have a high libido. 
                            Men would call it their roster so that they didn't get attached, 
                            or they had another one in line just in case one got attached. 
                            Me? I thought each guy served a different purpose, 
                            whether that be one that was handy when it came to 
                            helping with work, one that was good in bed (that's a lie they were all good in bed – some more than others but hey! They all had their specialities, so I had to keep them all) and one with a real connection who was easy to talk to. Covid made me pick and choose. Some left on their own, some left due to familial obligations, and some stayed. Not saying that Covid made me monogamous, but it did help me realise which was the better guy, which was the guy that would bother checking up on me, helping me through my BA dissertation. I had always believed that open relationships and casually seeing men were ideal for a commitment-phobe like me. It helped build trust and transparency with sexual partners and made me feel more secure that he was telling me everything, there was no hiding, what better way to build up to exclusivity? 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, as two men left my menu, one was left. We somehow decided without deciding that the "support bubble" was each other. That being said, old me was thinking that he just wanted me as a convenient vagina, since we were both left without flatmates during lockdown. Things became more constant, sleepovers and dinners and breakfast to be specific. Which yikes, that was brand-new territory. 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            "So you're exclusive, right?" <br/>
                            "No, not really we just like spending weekends together to drink and have dinner and sex, eat breakfast together, not like we can do anything else really, he is my only entertainment out there"<br/>
                            "But it's exclusive?" <br/>
                            "I mean for the time being, I guess? But for health and safety reasons only" 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            "For health and safety reasons only" still echoes to me post lockdown. Made me wonder, "what now?" I was suddenly insecure again. Did Covid make me want monogamy? Did Covid make me monogamous without knowing it? 
 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Maybe I could say Covid propelled me to wonder where this was going, made me think of reasons why he chose me to have sex with during lockdown. And that it was something that scared me. It was marching me closer to the point where people would label what you're doing as "a relationship" and with that word comes a set of expectations, especially once restrictions had been lifted. Would he meet my friends? Does this mean I have to meet his friends? What about our nights in? Would that still continue?, would I have to order 2 cocktails, and grab 2 glasses, cutlery, and plates? Do I have to remember what his favourite drink is? Will he help me move apartments? Did I have to be emotionally supportive to him like how he was to me?

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All this I have experienced since post lockdown. He met my friends, he still made time to see me weekdays and weekends, continued emotional and physical support, and yet people ask me:

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            "So you're dating"<br/>
                            "Are you just going to continue without a label? Don't you feel you need assurance?" <br/>
                            "So where is it going to end up leading to though?"

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To be honest, I don't know, because there are no obligations and the fun of it is seeing boundaries get pushed every month, it's still a game that old me was used to. Maybe we are both scared, but not knowing keeps it interesting. Because there were no words like "relationship" forcing him to come to mine or helping me move, or being forced to have dinners with my friends. He chose me to be his bubble, and somehow that was reassuring. No expectations or contracts, his willing presence meant more to me because I could know for certain that it was just his own mind bringing him to do the things with me and choosing to see me, not out of a label of expectations and obligations. And so far that's good enough for me. And hey for a commitment-phobe like me, being monogamous for 11 months was already a win and made me think that I could be monogamous if he asked me to. 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So I continue to ask myself, "who is going to take the next step? Him or me?"

                                “In feminist theory, the male gaze is the act of depicting women in the visual arts and in literature, from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as sexual objects for the pleasure of the heterosexual male viewer. The concept was first used by the English art critic John Berger in Ways of Seeing, as part of his analysis of the treatment of women as objects in advertising and nudes in European painting. It soon became popular among feminist theorists, including the British film critic Laura Mulvey, who used it to critique traditional media representations of the female character in cinema, and coined the phrase.”

                            When I talk about Cher, Madonna, and Janet Jackson, they usually come up in conversation with friends as literal icons that have shaped and moulded contemporary pop culture as we know it. With Cher's 'I am a rich man' interview snippet from the 80s, to Madonna's pop star legacy as the queen of pop and Janet Jackson's chart-topping hits; all three women have paved the way for contemporary artists, musicians, models, and creatives. From jaw-dropping runway looks; like Cher’s completely sheer beaded gown with white feathered sleeves and a white feathered skirt at the Met Gala in 1974, to Madonna’s timeless 80s red lip + bushy eyebrow makeup look.

                            I've chosen to speak about these three icons, not only because of how they continue to influence contemporary visual culture, from fashion to makeup to art direction in music videos. But because they can be studied through different theories of iconoclasm: seeing as all three of them assertively rejected cherished beliefs and institutions, along with established heteronormative values and practices within the music and performance industry. An example of this being that Cher actively rejected antiquated societal standards when it came to her showing her tattoos publicly, during a time when inked skin still had a bad reputation. She never let anyone else’s opinion hold her back from doing what she wanted to do for herself. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Notwithstanding, these figures, and their respective public images, have been moulded and shaped by the male gaze. Seeing as the performance industry has been built upon the objectification of the female figure, as the submissive, sultry, and sexy ‘object’ that can remain voiceless. Yet, always cater to male desires through their body and their appearance, which has subsequently set up unrealistic body standards for both men and women. With men thinking that women retain an ability to look a certain way for the pleasure of men, and for women to receive a constant stream of imagery of beauty standards built upon this objectified view marketed to them as how a ‘desirable’ woman should look and behave. 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Yet, these three icons have been able to break away from this objectified entrapment by claiming their own agency and power over their brand image; through personal interviews, music videos produced and directed by them, tweets, Instagram posts and a series of introspective projects that delve deeper into their personal stories, and no longer rest solely on the surface of their physical appearance. 

                        </p>

                            Janet Jackson led her own rebranding in order to separate herself from her family name in an extremely effective way by establishing herself as a mononym. She tackled sexual intimacy with an empowered stance reflective of her Control and Rhythm Nation era, which asserted her independence and social justice leanings. In her nineties' rebirth, her song ‘Janet’ explored everything from foreplay to oral sex. She maintained that an active sex life does not deter a woman from being a role model figure, and she placed a heavy emphasis on safe sex in her visuals. Thus, with her music production and visuals, she heavily influenced other female stars to become more openly sexual, due to the confidence, sexual agency and ownership Janet exuded and demanded for herself. Because of Janet, the 90s was the beginning of a new era, where sex and sexuality could move to the centre of the pop-music conversation and more importantly it allowed Janet to push boundaries not only for herself, but for her other female peers.

                            It is important to note how each of these stars had different timelines with regard to their rise to fame, and how each of them were seen as the first to shatter the standardized rules set out for female artists. Each one of them ensured that their voice and visuals reflected their real desires, completely unapologetic about their sexuality and sensuality. Yet, Janet's career took a 180-turn when Justin Timberlake tore off part of her costume, revealing her nipple at the Super Bowl Half-time Show in 2004. The show was produced by MTV that year, and for the split second that Janet was assaulted it generated

                                "A domino effect that made Janet Jackson the most-searched person and term of 2004 and 2005. The incident broke the record for "most-searched event over one day". It became the most-watched, recorded and replayed television moment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo"><i>TiVo</i></a> history and "enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo] 
                                subscribers to sign up". The term "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardrobe_malfunction">wardrobe malfunction</a>" was coined as a result of the incident, 
                                and was eventually added to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster%27s_Dictionary">Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</a>".

                            The many theories surrounding this incident of the show suggest how it was pre-planned by Timberlake to create this objectifying and shaming gaze around Janet by violently exposing her body. Thus, upholding a continuous power dynamic between the objectifying male gaze – which has always been mutually constituted in a patriarchal system that controls the music and pop culture industry to this day. This incident caused Janet’s career to become the centre of attention and formed an extremely invasive lens onto her public image and body. Completely removing her agency over how her own body was ‘searched’ up and viewed by the world. 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, Cher, Madonna, and Janet Jackson have in many ways built their own narrative in which their own bodies, voices, and 'brand image' fight against the double standard that encourages men to express their sexual interests in an invasive and completely uninterrupted way, yet demands a woman to suppress hers in any way shape or form. Where female sexuality is only ever catered to the public eye in relation to the male gaze. 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What these three icons have created for themselves now is the ‘blueprint’ for artists like Doja Cat, Saweetie, Ariana Grande and so many others. Janet, Madonna and Cher have effectively set the standard for the OG 'hot girl' – a phrase coined by Megan Thee Stallion as a woman who owns her sexuality, prowess, independence, whilst always maintaining her own values and respect for her other female peers. In Megan's own words, 'it really is easier to be nice than to be mean' and her confidence is symbiotic with this statement of being inclusive of all women who feel confident in themselves.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By continuing to reference Cher, Madonna, and Janet Jackson whenever we speak about music, clubbing culture, fashion/makeup looks, runway looks and art direction, it’s crystal clear how each of these stars have built up their own legacy and how it continues to thrive in the contemporary- with, for instance, the collaborative mentorship project between Saweetie and Cher that has influenced Saweetie’s album production and visuals. 

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This relationality between these icons and contemporary pop culture is not only evident in the way other upcoming female artists are reclaiming their space within the industry, but also in how women from different demographics in our contemporary setting are determined to remain unapologetic, unfiltered and defiant in regard to how they want to express their sexuality or not. Whether that be through fashion, makeup, dance, music, modelling, and any other outlet which allows them to be confident and assertive, by completely rejecting the standard ‘mould’ that has been built up for centuries by the male gaze.
