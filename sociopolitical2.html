                    Ethnic, exotic, oriental, are all terms and words that I've heard on countless occasions to
                    describe not only Asian
                    cuisines and dishes, but they are more prominently associated with the depiction and
                    representation of Asian women, both
                    onscreen and in our current contextual setting. The seminal and heavily cited work by Edward
                    Said, has coined this form
                    of exoticization of the East, or 'the Orient', in his work <a
                        href="https://www.eaford.org/site/assets/files/1631/said_edward1977_orientalism.pdf">Orientalism</a>
                    in which he "considers Orientalism as a powerful European ideological creation - a way for
                    writers, philosophers and
                    colonial administrators to deal with the 'otherness' of eastern culture, customs and
                    beliefs" (Said, 2003). Thus, giving
                    way to contemporary racist beliefs and Othering philosophies within our contextual setting.
                    The ‘orientalizing’ of
                    entire people groups and countries has filtered into our everyday vernacular – when speaking
                    about Other(s), and trying
                    to superimpose this Orientalist ideology within the everyday.

                    Unfortunately, my own experiences, like so many others in my social environment, have become
                    a by-product of this
                    dynamic between the hyper-sexualisation of Asian females and media-generated representations
                    of women in manga/anime
                    that have permeated into Eurocentric media outlets and pop-culture - along with early onset
                    depictions of Asian female
                    characters in Hollywood, with movies such as Daughter of Dragon (1931), The World of Suzie
                    Wong (1960), Year of the
                    Dragon (1985).

                    Having moved from San Francisco to Rome during my early adolescent years, I was made so
                    readily aware of how my physical
                    features immediately defined me to others around me: being called cinesina (which literally
                    translates into small
                    Chinese girl) and constantly being reminded how 'flat' my face was, or how ‘oriental’ I
                    looked. How I looked and sounded
                    to the rest of the people in my classroom became so embedded in how I viewed myself, as
                    always different to the rest of
                    my (white) classmates, constantly exoticized through this Othering lens.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Now I’ve had the chance to speak more and more about these instances of microaggressions and
                    racism that occured at such
                    an early age with other friends, who had also experienced the same types of interactions.
                    This has made me realize just
                    how normalized this form of sexualized racism is, which led me – like others – to oftentimes
                    suppress this responsive
                    anger or irritation towards these comments, seeing as it felt like even if we said something
                    back then it wouldn’t make
                    a difference, as even the teachers in these classrooms were aware of these comments being
                    said and still remained
                    silent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Immediately defining a person based on their 'oriental and exotic' features, has created
                    demeaning and degrading
                    language and has constructed racial tropes that have led people to think they are able to
                    pinpoint everything about a
                    woman solely based on the fact that 'she looks Asian'. These stereotyped tropes are so
                    deeply imbedded in historical
                    depictions of Asian women, and as suggested by cultural theorist and scholar Stuart Hall,
                    these constructions of
                    Other(ness) are heavily intertwined with identity politics, which “get hold of the few
                    simple and easily grasped,
                    characteristics about a person and reduce everything about the person to those traits,
                    fixing them into eternity”
                    (Merskin, 2009). It is precisely this notion of longevity that upholds and reinforces racial
                    caricatures in our everyday
                    life. This is exemplified through several North American comedy films that make fun of Asian
                    nail salons and their
                    employees' accents, or martial arts movies that play upon these embedded stereotypes of the
                    'kung fu master', or the
                    submissive Asian sub-character. Hall further speaks about how "consistency of stereotypical
                    portrayals is likely to add
                    credibility to those portrayals, as they take on an aura of naturalness and truth" (Merskin,
                    2009). Hence, these
                    portrayals are "constantly reified through the lack of contradictory images and information"
                    (Merskin, 2009), present in
                    our spaces of the everyday, as a byproduct of media-generated stereotypes.

                    <a href="https://www.kyokotakenaka.com/">Kyoko Takenaka</a> is a Japanese-American musician,
                    filmmaker, director and
                    performer, whose work HOME speaks directly to this ongoing and normalized take on the
                    fetishization of Asian women, by primarily
                    white-cis men. Takenaka recorded countless conversations in bars, on dates, and in ubers
                    with men commenting on her own
                    heritage, her appearance, and making sweeping statements on their 'take' on Asian cultural,
                    culinary histories, and
                    Asian countries. She directly conveys the shared interaction we as asian women face with
                    strangers who try to ‘flirt’ by
                    guessing our ethnicity, or by saying that 'they just have a thing' for Asian women. These
                    interactions are the product
                    of centuries of degrading interpretations of East Asia and Southeast Asian (visual) culture,
                    which has moulded
                    sexualized representations of Asian women; depicted as cute and or submissive.

                <p>
                    Takenaka films her blank facial expressions as she records herself listening to these audio
                    recordings. Her building
                    anger and frustration are all subtly shown through her blankness, the slight raising of her
                    eyebrows, and her side eye.
                    Her still shots not only depict just how normalized these interactions are, especially in
                    Western Europe and North
                    America, but they show how oftentimes these statements saying, that “I looooove asian food,
                    but will never eat chicken
                    feet”, generate such a disbelief upon hearing them that the rage and anger one feels towards
                    these comments can be
                    processed much later on. In fact, as stated by Takenaka herself “she sat there in disbelief
                    every time digesting the
                    audacity of these men, recording and archiving allowed me the space to know that one day, my
                    anger and trauma would be
                    used for something; it would not swallow or eat me whole then or now" (Takenaka, 2021).


                </p>

                <p>
                    Takenaka’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/242145479"><i>HOME</i></a> video is triggering me for
                    me, like many others, yet it can be seen as a way to convey just how intertwined racism and
                    hyper-fetishisization are, and although it "centers Takenaka's Othering in such close
                    proximity to whiteness” (Takenaka,
                    2021), this video pushes forth new types of discussions, ones of outrage and of showing just
                    how universal these
                    experiences can be for so many women.

                    Ultimately, I believe that we can celebrate differences (whether that be cultural, social,
                    and or historical), as
                    ‘difference’ is not the issue here. It is how we frame, depict, represent, and speak about
                    differences that leads there
                    to be such polarizing, degrading, and fetishizing representations of Asian women - through a
                    sexual, racial, and
                    ethnicizing lens. In order to unmake the decades of stereotyped and fetishized tropes
                    surrounding Asian (femme)
                    representation, we have to start creating a space for discussion: through artworks, through
                    music, through film, in
                    which (accessible) discussions are designed and displayed for the people and do not simply
                    reproduce the same logic of
                    display about Others. These conversations can acts as a crucial tool in the reimagining of a
                    logic of representation,
                    and of difference that discards linearity and completely unmakes a heteronormative logic of
                    racial governance and
                    fetishization. Organizations like <a

                    stereotyping, hate crimes and hyper fetishization have no place to be reified within. Where
                    our cultural and social
                    ‘differences’ are no longer seen as a 'marker' to hyper sexualize or fetishize us.
