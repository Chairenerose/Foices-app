                        Dutch student associations are social organisations for Dutch college and university
                        students. It is common for these
                        student associations to be a home base for a collective group of sororities and
                        fraternities. For many students, joining
                        a student association can provide a home away from home. Thus, each year, thousands of
                        students are extremely eager to
                        follow a formal recruitment process in the hopes of pledging to a sorority or
                        fraternity.
                        Although being part of this
                        prestigious members-only community is rewarding, the exclusiveness of this community is
                        often misconstrued to be a
                        social organisation perpetuating a culture of toxicity.

                    </i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    When one does join a student association, their friends and family are often quick to judge
                    them, especially when that
                    individual does not fit the description of a “typical student association” member. These
                    initial
                    confused and carping
                    remarks are something Jazzmin Hoepel (23) is far too familiar with. Despite being born in
                    Limburg to a Dutch mother and
                    Surinamese father, she grew up in Utrecht, a part of two different worlds, growing up in a
                    multicultural neighbourhood
                    yet attended a posh public high school. It was clear that from a young age, Jazzmin knew how
                    to
                    adapt to new
                    environments. When Jazzmin joined the student association Plato in Tilburg in 2019 and
                    pledged
                    to the Sorority Amendus
                    Amandus, she had no trouble fully immersing herself in this social environment. Since then,
                    she
                    has joined various
                    committees at Plato and is currently a board member of the ‘Bodemdrift Festival’ organized
                    by
                    Amendus Amandus. Despite
                    the numerous opportunities provided to her, Jazzmin is often met with confusing gazes when
                    she
                    discloses her affiliation
                    to student associations. This is due to the general interpretation that student associations
                    are
                    for “rich white
                    families”. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Plato is a place where everyone is welcome. There is not necessarily one specific
                    demographic
                    that makes up the majority
                    of the association’s members. This eventually convinced Jazzmin to become a member.

                </p>

                <div class="quote">
                    <h4>“I was attracted to Plato as not everyone looked alike; in terms of colour, behaviour
                        and
                        physical appearances”</h4>
                </div>

                <div class="text-image">

                </div>

                <p>
                    Jazzmin was confident that she would fit right into an association where differences are
                    celebrated. Surprisingly, this
                    overly-optimistic outlook on student associations was first ominous when her friend shared
                    her
                    plans on joining a
                    student association three years ago. At that time, Jazzmin perceived student associations to
                    be
                    an unnecessary waste of
                    time, where forced friendships are glorified. It follows that many share these biased
                    perceptions of student
                    associations. A range of factors has fuelled the construction of these stereotypes. Starting
                    with past tragedies that
                    highlight the dark side of these associations, to the role television series such as <a
                        href="https://www.bnnvara.nl/feuten"><i>Feuten</i></a> and <a
                        href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80995039">Ares</a> have played
                    where
                    problematic aspects of Dutch student association life is both glorified and mocked.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, student associations are often segregated from the general community in these
                    student cities. Thus,
                    judgements are effortlessly made. As the exclusivity of these associations leaves the public
                    with limited information
                    about them. Therefore, to understand these groups, they are categorized according to the
                    labels
                    provided to the public.
                    For instance, what is showcased by the media. This simplification of the unknown is what
                    leads
                    to the construction of
                    generalized stigmas of Dutch student associations.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The result of this bubble that has been formed around Dutch student associations across
                    cities
                    in the Netherlands is
                    that they have become a community of their own. Despite the numerous associations in
                    multiple
                    cities, they all
                    understand each other to some extent. This exclusion has generated a general opinion that
                    student associations are only
                    for a specific race, size and class. What has further triggered this presumption is that
                    student
                    associations are
                    predominantly white. Thus, associations are often accused of excluding non-white races from
                    these societies. In addition
                    to that, there have been numerous tragedies where students from non-white backgrounds have
                    experienced racial
                    discrimination within these associations. Understanding the lack of multiculturalism within
                    these associations is not as
                    easy as the public presumes it is.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Having been a member for more than a year, Jazzmin believes Dutch student associations are
                    currently open to all
                    prospective students. However, a particular demographic of students are most likely to
                    express
                    their interest in them.
                    Usually, these students already know before enrolling in university that pledging to a
                    sorority
                    or fraternity is
                    essential to experiencing the best type of student life. In addition, the financial position
                    of
                    an individual or their
                    family also plays a role, as “joining a student association is just an expensive joke”,
                    seeing
                    as being part of an
                    association can cost you hundreds of euros. This may insinuate that students who are
                    second-generation immigrants to the
                    Netherlands don’t necessarily have the goal of joining a student association as their number
                    one
                    priority during
                    university.

                </p>

                <div class="quote">
                    <h4>“I have witnessed it myself in my neighbourhood that is predominantly inhabited with
                        immigrants. There isn’t much talk
                        of sororities”
                    </h4>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This provided a sharp difference from the general conversations at her high school, where
                    many
                    of her classmates were
                    impressed by student associations, probably due to the privileges of being a native.
                    Ultimately,
                    Jazzmin advocates that
                    it is crucial to bear in mind that “one’s environment has a lot of influence on the choices
                    one
                    makes without even
                    noticing it at that moment”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1936724420947010"><i>homophily
                            effect</i></a> clarifies why students are so often attracted to social
                    organisations that resemble their
                    characteristics. Being around others with similar values, attitudes, behaviours, or even
                    being
                    of the same race can
                    increase one’s comfort level in social situations. This theory offers another reason as to
                    why
                    student associations are
                    predominantly white. When questioned on race in student associations, Jazzmin acted in
                    congruence with this theory,
                </p>

                <div class="quote">
                    <h4>“it just attracts you faster when you identify with the image a student association
                        portrays”
                    </h4>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Nonetheless, this simplified explanation of why Dutch student associations look the way they
                    do
                    is often not accepted by
                    the public. Associations often face criticism for their diversity and inclusion efforts.
                    Jazzmin
                    vehemently disagrees;
                    on the contrary, she believes that “it has to happen naturally” and offers another solution
                    in
                    which associations could
                    dedicate more time to inclusive representation on their social media and event posters. This
                    tactic may reach a more
                    diverse audience, as it’s easier to identify with someone who looks like you than someone
                    who
                    doesn’t look like you.
                </p>

                <p>Diversity is what subconsciously influenced Jazzmin to pledge to the sorority Amendus
                    Amandus.
                    Although she immediately
                    clicked with the other ladies, Jazzmin has realised that seeing other ladies who looked like
                    her
                    may have influenced her
                    pledging decision.
                </p>

                <div class="quote">
                    <h4>“I think because I saw other girls like me, that gave me a good gut feeling”

                    Her intuition was on point as, since then, she has formed long-lasting friendships and is
                    “happy
                    to be there, especially
                    in a city where you don’t know anyone”. Although her experience at Plato and AA has been
                    nothing
                    short of remarkable, as
                    she is fully immersed in this student life, Jazzmin is fully aware that she is the only
                    black
                    friend for some of her
                    student association friends, which for Jazzmin is both a gift and a curse.
                </p>

                <div class="quote">
                    <h4>“As soon as people get to know you, they do not really care about your background”
                    </h4>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Though, to make her feel included, Jazzmin has sometimes had to hear that her peers don’t
                    see
                    colour. This dismissal of
                    racial identity may have been done with the right intentions, yet her reaction to this
                    statement
                    was toe-curling. As
                    “colours are there to be seen and not to be ignored ”. Unfortunately, Jazzmin has also
                    experienced these insensitive
                    situations in which stereotypical jokes are made. She assumes that the students who have
                    made
                    these remarks probably
                    find the jokes acceptable, as they are not about her. This has left her to wonder if her
                    presence or the relationships
                    she has formed in the association is the only reason she is not targeted by these jokes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It goes to say that Jazzmin is fully aware of the controversies surrounding Dutch student
                    associations. That being said,
                    she has been fortunate enough not to be a victim of these tragedies. She is grateful for the
                    opportunities Plato has
