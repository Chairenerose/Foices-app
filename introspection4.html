                <p>Love is Love. That's the motto of our community. Yet love, even within our modern times, is
                    still such a controversial
                    term. Being gay and being able to love and be loved is still not allowed and a problem in
                    many countries. As a Persian,
                    I am aware of how socially conservative societies can make it extremely challenging for one
                    to live their truth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being bullied, mistreated and discriminated against are a few of the common intolerant
                    attitudes an LGBTQ+ person faces
                    daily. We have to tolerate many things. It could be the weird faces people make when you
                    walk hand in hand with someone
                    else, the insensitive questions other people ask, or if it is the way you have been taught
                    in school that only men and
                    women are allowed to love each other.

                <p>
                    It doesn’t even affect me any more if somebody calls me ‘f*ggot“ or comments some bible
                    verse under my Instagram profile
                    telling me how being gay will send me to hell. Not only that, but it is a part of my life,
                    which I was forced to adapt
                    to. Many of our community had to adapt to the hatred of the people and accept it because it
                    is easier than to change
                    those people’s mindset.

                </p>

                <p>
                    For people not in my skin, being gay seems so easy, as they have never been confronted with
                    all the issues that come
                    with the colourful rainbow. Moreover, even within the rainbow, there is still a lot of room
                    for improvement as
                    discrimination and racism also extend to our rows.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Nevertheless, I am thankful for pride month, as it raises awareness about the people who
                    have been mistreated for
                    decades. Pride reminds me that my existence is valid and provides understanding to younger
                    people who still struggle
                    with their identity to understand that the possibility of being different exists. I am
                    looking very forward to the
                    future of our community. I am thankful to know that the coming generations have to face less
                    injustice as previous
                    generations did.
