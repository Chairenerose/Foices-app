                    As I began writing this piece, I had to reckon with an ongoing relationality between
                    personal introspection and
                    historical research. There is so much active oppression in the world that it makes you
                    wonder if your cause is more
                    important than the cause of your peers. Unfortunately, minority groups worldwide are
                    impacted by oppression, when in
                    fact, we all deserve the right to equality, justice, dignity and freedom. One shouldn’t have
                    to fight for the spotlight.
                    Nevertheless, sometimes the spotlight skips a community, which is why it is up to
                    individuals to ensure that the stories
                    of their people are told. This is the story of Maluku.

                </div>

                <p>
                    Maluku is a hidden tropical paradise that almost seems too good to be true. Maluku is an
                    archipelago above Australia,
                    next to West Papua and Timor-Leste. Please note that I purposely neglected to mention
                    Indonesia. The Maluku Islands have
                    been considered part of Oceania’s Melanesia region. Like the other regions of Oceania,
                    Maluku has beautiful reefs, empty
                    stretches of powdery white sand beaches, mountains and rainforests. With the Banda Sea,
                    Maluku has one of the deepest
                    seas globally, more than 7,000 meters deep. The Maluku Islands are also rich in natural
                    resources, such as gold and
                    petrol.
                </p>

                <p> The indigenous people of Maluku are called AlifURU, which means the first human (man and
                    woman). The AlifURU come from
                    NunuSaku - the birthplace of humankind - The first people left NunuSaku in groups, and their
                    descendants populated all
                    four corners of the earth. All nations evolved from the four Human Children and the four
                    human species, the white human,
                    the yellow human, the black human, and the <a href="www.nusaalifuru.org">brown human</a>. So
                    yes, we divided groups based on skin colour, but we never segregated communities based on
                    skin colour. Translated
                    into the contemporary, you can say that the indigenous people(s) of Maluku were the first to
                    practice inclusivity and
                    diversity.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Moreover, each island has maintained its traditions, beautiful tribe stories, culture and
                    language. Our way of life is
                    “Adat” ; There is one God, The Highest. Thus, our rights and obligations are established and
                    regulated according to this
                    principle. This includes the division of land, caring for our natural living environment,
                    and keeping a balanced life.
                    Furthermore, the Adat shows how to maintain relationships with different islands or tribe
                    clans. Therefore, we can feel
                    equally connected; we have always lived with diversity, peace and harmony.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Maluku was known as the Spice Islands between the 16th and 18th century. The islands were
                    the world’s only supplier of
                    nutmeg, cloves and mace. Back then, these spices were considered very vital and very
                    valuable trade commodities. The
                    search and subsequent fight for control of Maluku helped kick-start European colonialism.
                    Maluku was first exploited by
                    the Portuguese and then the Dutch. The arrival of the Dutch resulted in a significant
                    alteration in the social and
                    political landscape of Maluku.

                </p>

                <p>
                    As a result of colonialism, Maluku people know oppression like no other. That is why today,
                    we reflect on all the
                    injustice in the world. The world needs all the help it can to overcome the effects of
                    centuries of inequality and
                    oppression. That is why I am an advocate for
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/change.the.future.of.maluku1/">
                        <i>Change The Future of Maluku</i>
                    </a>. A movement to raise awareness for equality, justice, dignity and freedom for the
                    people of Maluku.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In Maluku, women have actively pushed forth calls for change and accountability. Two of our
                    heroes are Martha Christina
                    Tiahahu and Hansina Uktolseja. These two women stood up against colonial oppression and
                    aggression to free the Maluku
                    people. To enhance awareness for women’s rights in Maluku, I began a petition for our first
                    lady. She is considered the
                    mother of our people. Her name is Njonja Soumokil, and she still lives in exile in The
                    Netherlands. Her husband, Mr Dr
                    Christiaan Soumokil, was our president and a freedom fighter. He was unlawfully executed 55
                    years ago by an Indonesian
                    firing squad on the 12th of April 1966.

                <p>
                    Mrs Soumokil has been looking for his grave ever since. However, her case entirely depends
                    on the Indonesian
                    government's willingness to make the location of the grave public. According to a Dutch
                    court ruling in 2018, the Dutch
                    government is obligated to investigate the exact location of her husband's grave. In order
                    to provide Mrs Soumokil with
                    the exact location of her husbands grave, a <a
                        href="https://www.petities.com/help_njonja_onderzoek_naar_exacte_rustplaats_mr_dr_chr_soumokil_moet_komen">petition</a>
                    has been made. To motivate the Dutch Government to apply more pressure on Indonesian
                    authorities to conform to international law.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The world needs to know that colonialism did not end simply because the Dutch left.
                    In 1949 after a war of independence, the Dutch ceded control of the archipelago. During the
                    decolonisation process,
                    Maluku leaders counselled the people. With the people's true will, they declared the
                    Republik Maluku Selatan (RMS)
                    independence on the 25th of April 1950. But this did not last long. Though the Dutch left,
                    they left their colonial
                    imprints behind, as their colonial roots provided the blueprint for Indonesia to take over
                    as an oppressor. More
                    specifically, to hold on to favourable trade relations.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Moreover, Indonesia invaded the capital island of Maluku, Ambon. Thus, the illegal
                    annexation of the RMS became real. As
                    a result of Indonesia's neo-colonialism, Maluku has been left in poverty and has prevented
                    any form of development
                    favouring the local population. Maluku is now a province of Indonesia and listed as the 4th
                    poorest province of
                    Indonesia's
                    <a href="https://www.indonesia-investments.com/finance/macroeconomic-indicators/poverty/item301">34
                        provinces
                    </a>. <i>Change The Future of Maluku</i> provides support in building communication,
                    leadership and political processes for freedom of the oppressed people of
                    Maluku. Our goal is to provide the local population with the tools to free themselves from
                    the Indonesian neocolonial
                    tentacles, enabling them to determine their future.

                <p>
                    I am here to learn, share lessons learned, overcome challenges and work together to thrive
                    through conversation. I want
                    the world to understand that neocolonialism still exists in various forms and locations.
                    Furthermore, I aim to explain
                    this by starting with the story of Maluku. We don’t have to fight over the spotlight, but we
                    must share the spotlight to
                    educate the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Together we catalyse positive change by networking and funding the youth-led community human
                    rights movements and
                    liberation campaigns in Maluku. Focus on changing public opinion is essential to gain the
                    support of the international
                    community. It takes a lot of courage to stand against the oppressor, Indonesia, knowing
                    nobody is watching. At this
                    moment, dozens of peaceful Maluku activists face lifetime jail sentences because they raised
                    our flag. Razzias are held
                    randomly by the Indonesian State Army to arrest Maluku freedom fighters. In other words,
                    anyone who expresses a free
                    opinion, especially if it is politically oriented, is silenced.

                    Everyone has the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of
                    opinion and expression, the
                    right to work and education and many more (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UDHR).
                    Human rights arise simply by
                    being a human being. We are all equally entitled to our human rights without discrimination.
                    These rights are all
                    interrelated, interdependent and indivisible. Unfortunately, it is too difficult for the 2.1
                    million civilians in Maluku
                    to speak up about it. Please help us amplify their voices. So the world can hear the untold
                    violations of humanitarian
                    and human rights law due to the neocolonialism by Indonesia in the annexed Republik Maluku
                    Selatan. Through this
                    support, the people in Maluku will be aware that they are not alone. The international
                    community is watching and
                    creating platforms for the people of Maluku to break their silence.

                <p>
                    The F-OICE-S of the oppressed must be amplified to make positive changes in this beautiful
                    world we are living in. To
                    protect our land, oceans, animals and our people. All our people! Equally!

                    I want to leave you with this song <i>Jangan putus harapanmu</i> (don’t give up your hope).
                    It is a song I wrote saying do not give up hope, just believe that Maluku will be free.
